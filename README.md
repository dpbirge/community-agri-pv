# Community Agri-PV Simulation Model

An educational simulation tool for farming communities exploring co-ownership models for water, energy, and agricultural systems. Simulates a collective farm in the Sinai Peninsula, Egypt (hot arid climate, year-round irrigation) to help communities understand trade-offs between infrastructure configurations, policies, and risk management strategies.

Uses a three-layer architecture: pre-computed physical libraries (Layer 1), scenario configuration with 23 policies across 6 domains (Layer 2), and daily time-step simulation with energy dispatch, water allocation, and economic tracking (Layer 3). All layers implemented with 78 validated datasets, functional policies for water, energy, food, crop, economic, and market decisions, and a working simulation that compares allocation strategies across multiple farms over multi-year periods.
