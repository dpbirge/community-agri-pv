# Community Agri-PV Simulation Model

An educational simulation tool for farming communities exploring co-ownership models for water, energy, and agricultural systems. Simulates a collective farm in the Sinai Peninsula, Egypt (hot arid climate, year-round irrigation) to help communities understand trade-offs between infrastructure configurations, policies, and risk management strategies. Uses a three-layer architecture: pre-computed physical libraries (Layer 1), scenario configuration with 22 policies across 6 domains (Layer 2), and daily time-step simulation with energy dispatch, water allocation, and economic tracking (Layer 3).
