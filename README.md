# Community Agri-PV Simulation Model

An educational simulation tool for farming communities exploring co-ownership models for water, energy, and agricultural systems. Simulates a collective farm in the Sinai Peninsula, Egypt (hot arid climate, year-round irrigation) to help communities understand trade-offs between infrastructure configurations, policies, and risk management strategies.

Uses a three-layer architecture: pre-computed physical libraries (Layer 1), scenario configuration with policies across multiple domains (Layer 2), and daily time-step simulation with water allocation, energy dispatch, crop processing, market sales, economic tracking, and post simulation assessment and metrics. (Layer 3)
