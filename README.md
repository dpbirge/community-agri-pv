# Community Agri-PV Simulation Model

An educational simulation tool for farming communities exploring co-ownership models for water, energy, and agricultural systems. Simulates a collective farm in the Sinai Peninsula, Egypt (hot arid climate, year-round irrigation) to help communities understand trade-offs between infrastructure configurations, policies, and risk management strategies.

Uses a three-layer architecture: pre-computed physical libraries (Layer 1), scenario configuration (Layer 2), and daily time-step simulation (Layer 3). All layers are implemented with 50+ validated datasets, functional water policies, and a working water simulation MVP that compares water allocation strategies across multiple farms over 10-year periods.

See [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) for detailed developer documentation.
