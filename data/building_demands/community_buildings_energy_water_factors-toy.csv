# SOURCE: Synthetic data for community agri-PV model
# DATE: 2026-02-23
# DESCRIPTION: Community building types with energy and water demand profiles
# UNITS: energy_per_m2_per_day_kwh (kWh/m²/day), water_per_m2_per_day_m3 (m³/m²/day)
# LOGIC: Community buildings include offices, warehouse variants, meeting halls, workshops
# LOGIC: Warehouses split into: non-conditioned (ventilation only), climate-controlled (68F/20C), chilled (50F/10C)
# LOGIC: Water demand for bathrooms, cleaning, drinking water
# DEPENDENCIES: None
# ASSUMPTIONS: Hot arid climate (BWh). Warehouse baselines from ASHRAE/industry norms. Weather response uses degree-day physics.
# ASSUMPTIONS: Reasonably insulated construction (U~0.5 W/m²K climate-controlled, U~0.45 cold storage)
