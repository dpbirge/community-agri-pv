# SOURCE: Synthetic data for community agri-PV model
# DATE: 2026-02-02
# DESCRIPTION: Household types with energy and water demand profiles for ~150 person community
# UNITS: occupants_per_household (people), energy_per_household_per_day_kWh (kWh/day), water_per_household_per_day_m3 (cubic meters/day)
# LOGIC: Three household sizes representing typical rural Egyptian family structures
# LOGIC: Energy demand dominated by cooling (AC) in hot arid climate, plus refrigeration and lighting
# LOGIC: Water demand based on 75-100 liters per person per day for domestic use
# DEPENDENCIES: None
# ASSUMPTIONS: Population ~150 people distributed across ~35 households
# ASSUMPTIONS: Distribution: 6 small (2-person), 12 medium (4-person), 15 large (6-person) = 150 people in 33 households
# ASSUMPTIONS: Hot climate requires AC for 6-10 hours daily during summer months
# ASSUMPTIONS: All households have basic appliances (refrigerator LED lights fans phone charging)
# ASSUMPTIONS: Energy range 13-20 kWh/household/day per specification
# ASSUMPTIONS: Water range 0.3-0.6 m3/household/day per specification
