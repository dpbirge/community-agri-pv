# SOURCE: Generated from crop parameter files and daily weather data
# DATE: 2026-02-24
# DESCRIPTION: Daily crop growth lookup for onion planted 04-01
#   under openfield (spring season, 130 days).
#   One row per day of season for each (irrigation_policy, weather_year) combination.
#   The final day_of_season row contains the harvest yield in yield_fresh_kg_ha.
# ROWS: 9750
# CROP: onion
# PLANTING_DATE: 04-01
# CONDITION: openfield
# SEASON_LENGTH: 130 days
# IRRIGATION_POLICIES: full_eto (100%), optimal_deficit (80%), deficit_80 (80%), deficit_60 (60%), rainfed (0%)
# UNITS: eto_mm=mm/day, etc_mm=mm/day, water_applied_mm=mm/day,
#   fpar=fraction (0-1), biomass_kg_ha=kg DM/ha/day,
#   cumulative_biomass_kg_ha=kg DM/ha,
#   yield_fresh_kg_ha=kg fresh weight/ha (final day only)
# LOGIC: ETo via Hargreaves (FAO-56 Eq.52). ETc = Kc * ETo_ref * (1-ET_red).
#   Under PV, ETo_ref uses openfield temps to avoid double-counting.
#   Canopy interception fPAR ramps with growth stage (seedling→full canopy).
#   Daily biomass = RUE * PAR * fPAR * Ks * Kt (tracks growth dynamics).
#   Yield = potential_yield * (1 - Ky * deficit) * avg_Kt (FAO Paper 33).
#   PV light/temp attenuation captured in condition-specific weather files.
