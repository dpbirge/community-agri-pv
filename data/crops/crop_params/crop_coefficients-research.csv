# DESCRIPTION: Validated crop coefficients (Kc) by growth stage for irrigation scheduling
#   in Sinai Peninsula hot arid climate. Five crops: tomato, potato, onion (dry), kale
#   (using cabbage/brassica as proxy), cucumber.
# UNITS:
#   - kc_value: Crop coefficient (dimensionless, ratio of ETc to ETo)
#   - days_in_stage: Duration of growth stage (days)
#   - root_depth_m: Effective root depth during stage (meters)
#   - critical_depletion: Fraction of available water that can be depleted before stress (dimensionless)
# LOGIC: Kc values relate crop evapotranspiration (ETc) to reference evapotranspiration (ETo)
#   via ETc = Kc * ETo. The Kc curve has three key values: Kc_ini (initial), Kc_mid (mid-season
#   peak), Kc_end (harvest). During development stage, Kc transitions linearly from Kc_ini
#   to Kc_mid. During late stage, Kc transitions from Kc_mid to Kc_end.
# DEPENDENCIES: Reference evapotranspiration (ETo) from weather data
# ASSUMPTIONS:
#   - Hot arid climate (Sinai Peninsula, ~28N, 34E): RHmin ~25-35%, wind 2-3 m/s
#   - FAO-56 recommends +5% Kc_mid adjustment for arid conditions (Equation 62)
#   - Drip irrigation with partial soil wetting may reduce Kc by 10-30%; values here
#     assume well-watered full-cover conditions for maximum water demand estimation
#   - Stage durations from FAO-56 Table 11 arid climate examples
#   - Root depths are maximum effective depths; actual extraction is from upper 70%
# DATA_QUALITY: HIGH - FAO-56 is the international standard reference for crop water
#   requirements, based on extensive global research. Values validated against Egypt
#   field trials showing ±10-20% agreement with FAO-56 baseline.
# COMPARISON_TO_TOY:
#   - Toy file uses summary format (Kc_ini, Kc_mid, Kc_end per crop); this file uses
#     stage-based format (4 rows per crop with Kc progression)
#   - Toy Kc values include +5-10% arid adjustment; research values here are FAO-56 base
#   - Toy tomato Kc_mid=1.20 vs research Kc_mid=1.15 (toy has arid adjustment)
#   - Toy potato Kc_mid=1.18 vs research Kc_mid=1.15 (toy has arid adjustment)
#   - Toy onion Kc_mid=1.10 vs research Kc_mid=1.05 (toy has arid adjustment)
#   - Toy kale Kc_mid=1.10 vs research Kc_mid=1.05 (toy has arid adjustment, same proxy)
#   - Toy cucumber Kc_mid=1.05 vs research Kc_mid=1.00 (toy has arid adjustment)
#   - Root depths and depletion fractions are consistent between files
