# DESCRIPTION: Crop growth parameters for biomass accumulation and yield estimation
#   in Sinai Peninsula hot arid climate (~28N). Values used to convert daily intercepted
#   radiation and water supply into biomass accumulation and marketable yield.
# UNITS:
#   - potential_yield_kg_per_ha: Maximum attainable fresh yield under optimal conditions (kg/ha)
#   - harvest_index: Fraction of total above-ground dry biomass that is marketable product (dimensionless)
#   - rue_g_per_mj: Radiation use efficiency — above-ground dry biomass produced per MJ of
#     intercepted PAR (g DM / MJ PAR)
#   - dry_matter_fraction: Fraction of fresh weight that is dry matter (dimensionless)
#   - t_base_c: Base temperature below which growth ceases (degrees Celsius)
#   - t_opt_low_c: Lower bound of optimal temperature range (degrees Celsius)
#   - t_opt_high_c: Upper bound of optimal temperature range (degrees Celsius)
#   - t_max_c: Temperature above which growth ceases (degrees Celsius)
# LOGIC: Daily biomass = RUE * intercepted_PAR * water_stress_factor * temperature_factor.
#   Marketable yield = total_biomass * harvest_index / dry_matter_fraction (to convert to fresh weight).
#   Temperature factor is 0 below t_base or above t_max, ramps linearly from 0 to 1 between
#   t_base and t_opt_low, is 1.0 between t_opt_low and t_opt_high, and declines linearly
#   from 1 to 0 between t_opt_high and t_max.
# DEPENDENCIES: crop_coefficients-research.csv (stage durations), weather data
# ASSUMPTIONS:
#   - Potential yields are for irrigated conditions in warm arid climates (Egypt/Sinai benchmarks)
#   - RUE values are for total above-ground dry matter under non-stressed conditions
#   - Harvest index values are typical for well-managed irrigated production
#   - Temperature response parameters from FAO AquaCrop (Paper 66) and crop physiology literature
#   - Kale uses cabbage/brassica data as proxy (same species Brassica oleracea)
# DATA_QUALITY: HIGH — FAO Paper 33/66 and Monteith/Sinclair RUE values are standard references.
#   Potential yields cross-checked against Egyptian agricultural statistics.
