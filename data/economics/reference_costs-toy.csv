# SOURCE: Industry average estimates for infrastructure cost modeling, cross-referenced with capital_costs and operating_costs CSVs
# DATE: 2026-02-18
# DESCRIPTION: Simplified reference capital and O&M cost parameters used by estimate_infrastructure_costs() for community infrastructure costing. These are scaling factors (cost per unit of capacity) rather than equipment-specific quotes.
# UNITS: capital_cost_rate (USD per unit as specified), om_rate (USD per unit/yr or fraction of CAPEX as specified by om_type)
# LOGIC: Values represent industry-average estimates adjusted for community-scale infrastructure in hot arid climates. Distinct from detailed equipment specs in capital_costs and operating_costs CSVs which track component-level costs.
# DEPENDENCIES: Used by src/settings/calculations.py estimate_infrastructure_costs()
# ASSUMPTIONS: (1) All costs in 2024 USD, (2) Values are representative averages, not site-specific quotes
