# DESCRIPTION: PV system specifications for agri-PV installation at 3 density levels, Sinai Peninsula (28N 34E, BWh hot desert climate). N-type TOPCon monocrystalline panels elevated 3.5m for agri-PV crop clearance.
# UNITS: density_name (string), ground_coverage_pct (%), panel_type (string), module_efficiency (decimal), temp_coefficient_per_c (decimal/C), system_losses_pct (%), degradation_rate_per_year (decimal/year), tilt_angle_deg (degrees), azimuth_deg (degrees), panel_height_m (meters), lifespan_years (years), panel_wattage_w (W), panel_area_m2 (m2), panels_per_kw (panels/kW), shading_factor (decimal), temp_reference_c (C), tilt_factor (dimensionless), temp_adjustment_c (C), irradiance_factor (dimensionless)
# LOGIC: All densities use N-type TOPCon panels (22.5% module efficiency), representative of JinkoSolar Tiger Neo 580W and Trina Vertex N 585W class modules widely deployed in 2024-2025. Density affects ground coverage ratio, inter-row shading, ventilation (heat dissipation), and maintenance access (soiling losses). Tilt angle 25 deg optimized for year-round generation at 28N per PVGIS (optimal = lat*0.76+3.1 = 24.4 deg, rounded to 25). Tilt factor 1.10 from PVGIS comparison of GTI at 25 deg tilt vs GHI at 28N latitude (~10% annual gain). System losses include inverter (~3%), DC wiring (~1.5%), module mismatch (~2%), and soiling/dust in desert environment (4-6% with monthly cleaning; higher density = harder access = more accumulation). Panels per kW = 1000/580 = 1.72. Degradation 0.6%/yr based on NREL desert field studies showing 0.5-0.7%/yr for mono-Si in hot climates with NREL finding +0.15%/yr per 10C above temperate baseline. Shading factor is annual average PV inter-row shading retention: GCR 0.30 has minimal shading (~2% loss), GCR 0.50 has moderate morning/evening shading (~5% loss), GCR 0.80 has significant shading (~13% loss) per PVsyst ray-tracing models for fixed-tilt at low latitudes. temp_reference_c is the STC reference temperature (25C). temp_adjustment_c is the daily-average cell-to-ambient temperature offset derived from two independent models: (1) PVsyst thermal model T_c = T_a + alpha*G*(1-eta)/U_c with alpha=0.9, eta=0.225, G=275 W/m2 (24h average GTI for Sinai), and density-dependent U_c values (29/24/19 W/m2/K for low/med/high based on ventilation reduction from freestanding to semi-integrated); (2) NOCT model delta_T = (NOCT-20)*(G/800)*f_vent with NOCT=45C and ventilation adjustment factors (0.90/1.10/1.40). Final values are the mean of both methods. irradiance_factor is 1.0 for all densities (panels are the highest obstruction; no overhead shading).
# DEPENDENCIES: None
# ASSUMPTIONS: Fixed-tilt south-facing installation at 25 deg; 3.5m panel clearance for agricultural equipment and crop growth; hot desert environment (BWh) with regular dust accumulation requiring monthly cleaning; wind speed 3.5-4.5 m/s annual average at site; N-type TOPCon technology selected for superior temperature coefficient (-0.29 to -0.30%/C) and lower degradation vs PERC in hot climates per Qatar 3-year field study (Khatib et al. 2025). Temperature coefficient -0.0030/C is conservative for TOPCon (datasheets show -0.0029/C) to account for field aging. Module efficiency 22.5% represents commercial mean of 580W-class TOPCon (JinkoSolar 22.45%, Trina 22.8%). Panel dimensions 2278x1134mm (2.58 m2) per JinkoSolar Tiger Neo 72HL4 datasheet.
