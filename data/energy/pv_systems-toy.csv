# DESCRIPTION: PV system specifications for agri-PV installation at 3 density levels
# UNITS: density_name (string), ground_coverage_pct (%), panel_type (string), module_efficiency (decimal), temp_coefficient_per_c (decimal/C), system_losses_pct (%), degradation_rate_per_year (decimal/year), tilt_angle_deg (degrees), azimuth_deg (degrees), panel_height_m (meters), lifespan_years (years), panel_wattage_w (W), panel_area_m2 (m2), panels_per_kw (panels/kW), shading_factor (decimal), temp_reference_c (C), tilt_factor (dimensionless), temp_adjustment_c (C), irradiance_factor (dimensionless)
# LOGIC: All variants use same monocrystalline PERC panels (18.5% efficiency); density affects ground coverage and microclimate effects. Tilt optimized for 28N latitude. System losses include wiring, inverter, soiling, and mismatch losses. Standard 400W panels (1.96 m2 each) used for calculations. Panels per kW = 1000 / panel_wattage_w. Degradation rate 0.5%/yr per IEC 61215 for mono-crystalline Si. Shading factor is annual average PV output reduction from agri-PV crop shading — higher density means more inter-row shading losses. temp_reference_c is the STC reference temperature (25C). tilt_factor is the irradiance gain from fixed tilt at 28N latitude (1.05 ≈ 5% boost vs horizontal). temp_adjustment_c set to 0 for all densities (daily-mean cell-to-ambient offset not modeled separately; temperature derating uses ambient air temp directly). irradiance_factor is the fraction of GHI reaching panel surface (currently 1.0 for all densities since panels are above crops).
# DEPENDENCIES: None
# ASSUMPTIONS: Fixed-tilt south-facing installation; 3.0m clearance for agricultural equipment; hot desert environment increases soiling losses slightly; standard monocrystalline PERC panel wattage 400W; panel area 1.96 m2 per panel (typical for 400W mono-PERC)
# CONTEXT: Panel type: Monocrystalline PERC. Use case: Agri-PV installation. Standard sizes: Common panel sizes used in 2024.
