# DESCRIPTION: Farmgate distribution and sales labor requirements for a 500 ha community farm in
#              arid coastal Sinai, Egypt. Farmgate model: buyers come to the farm for pickup.
#              Covers sales operations, loading dock, dispatch QC, transport coordination,
#              market intelligence, and record keeping/traceability.
# UNITS: hours_per_day (daily recurring), hours_per_transaction (per buyer dispatch),
#        hours_per_ton (per ton dispatched), hours_per_week (weekly recurring)
# LOGIC: Farmgate model means the farm's distribution labor is coordination-focused, not transport-focused.
#        Assumes 3-8 buyer dispatches per day during harvest season, fewer off-season.
#        Per-transaction rates derived from FAO marketing management estimates and GS1 traceability standards.
#        Loading rates consistent with existing logistics_loading values (0.002 hrs/kg = 2 hrs/ton).
# DEPENDENCIES: worker_category_mapping-research.csv, labor_requirements-research.csv (logistics section)
# ASSUMPTIONS: Buyers bring own transport. Farm provides loading dock with manual handling (no forklift).
#              Semi-manual invoicing and documentation (paper + basic digital records).
#              5 fresh crops + processed products (canned, dried, packaged). Local/regional market reach.
#              3-8 dispatches/day peak season, 1-3/day off-season.
# DATA_QUALITY: MODERATE-LOW. ~60-70% of values are derived estimates. No published per-transaction
#               labor studies exist for Egypt/MENA farmgate operations. Aggregate daily totals are
#               consistent with FAO community farm marketing benchmarks. Sub-activity decomposition
#               uses proportional reasoning from the best available analogous data.
