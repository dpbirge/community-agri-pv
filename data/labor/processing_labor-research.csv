# DATE: 2026-02-05
# DESCRIPTION: Labor hours per kg of fresh input for each crop x processing type combination.
#              Extracted from processing_specs-research.csv to consolidate all labor data in data/labor/.
# UNITS: labor_hours_per_kg (hours per kg fresh input)
# LOGIC: Semi-manual community operations (~4x more labor-intensive than industrial).
#        Fresh = no processing labor. Packaged = sorting, grading, wrapping. Canned = prep, cooking, sealing, QC.
#        Dried = washing, slicing, loading/unloading dryers, quality sorting.
# DEPENDENCIES: None
# ASSUMPTIONS: Semi-automated community-scale equipment, not industrial. Hot arid climate (Sinai Peninsula).
