# SOURCE: Derived from labor_wages-research.csv worker categories and labor_requirements-toy.csv skill levels.
#         Skill-to-wage mapping informed by Egyptian National Council for Wages skill tier definitions,
#         ILO ISCO-08 occupation classification for agricultural workers,
#         FAO community farm staffing models for developing countries.
# DATE: 2026-02-24
# DESCRIPTION: Bridging table that maps the 10 worker categories (from labor_wages-research.csv) to
#              the 3-level skill system (from labor_requirements) and to value chain stages.
#              Enables costing labor hours (from requirements files) at category-specific wage rates.
# UNITS: wage_multiplier is dimensionless (1.0 = minimum wage baseline of EGP 28/hour)
# LOGIC: Each worker_category maps to exactly one skill_level. Multiple worker_categories may share a
#        skill_level. The value_chain_stages column lists where each category is primarily deployed.
#        wage_multiplier reflects the empirical ratio from labor_wages-research.csv
#        (egp_per_hour / 28 EGP baseline).
# DEPENDENCIES: labor_wages-research.csv, labor_requirements-research.csv
# ASSUMPTIONS: A single worker may perform tasks across multiple value chain stages in a community farm
#              setting, but their primary deployment and wage rate are fixed by category.
#              Seasonal harvesters are a distinct category from general field workers due to
#              different employment terms (piece-rate vs daily wage) and peak-season hours.
