# SOURCE: Synthetic data for community agri-PV model
# DATE: 2026-02-02
# DESCRIPTION: Farm profile types defining economic behavior and farm characteristics for 20-farm community
# UNITS: farm_size_ha (hectares), yield_factor (dimensionless multiplier 0.8-1.2), starting_capital_usd (USD)
# LOGIC: Distribution is 8 conservative (40%), 8 moderate (40%), 4 risk-tolerant (20%) farms
# LOGIC: Conservative farms are smaller, lower capital, cautious adopters
# LOGIC: Moderate farms represent average community members
# LOGIC: Risk-tolerant farms are larger, better capitalized, willing to try new technology
# DEPENDENCIES: None
# ASSUMPTIONS: Total farmland sums to 500 ha when farms are instantiated using these profiles
# ASSUMPTIONS: Mean farm sizes designed so 8*20 + 8*25 + 4*35 = 500 ha total
# ASSUMPTIONS: Starting capital reflects small-scale farming in Egyptian context
# CURRENCY_NOTE: All monetary values in USD (2024 basis)

conservative,20.0,3.0,0.95,0.05,15000,3000,Low risk tolerance - prefers proven technologies and traditional practices. Slow technology adopters. Prioritizes stability over potential gains. Will wait to see neighbors succeed before adopting new methods.
moderate,25.0,4.0,1.00,0.08,25000,5000,Medium risk tolerance - open to gradual improvements and community-supported initiatives. Follows early adopters after seeing initial success. Balances innovation with caution.
risk_tolerant,35.0,5.0,1.10,0.10,45000,8000,High risk tolerance - early adopters willing to experiment with agri-PV and new crop varieties. Larger farms with more capital buffer. Likely to pilot new technologies for the community.
