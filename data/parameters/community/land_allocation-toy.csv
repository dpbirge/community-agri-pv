# SOURCE: Synthetic data for community agri-PV model
# DATE: 2026-02-02
# DESCRIPTION: Land use allocation for 25 km2 (2500 ha) community in Sinai Peninsula, Egypt
# UNITS: area_ha (hectares), percentage_of_total (percent of 2500 ha total)
# LOGIC: Farmland is primary productive use at 500 ha (20% of total)
# LOGIC: Housing sized for ~150 people in ~35 households at typical rural density
# LOGIC: Ground-mounted solar separate from agri-PV (which is integrated with farmland)
# LOGIC: Roads follow rural community standards (~3-4% of developed area)
# LOGIC: Buffer zones provide separation between land uses and protect from desert encroachment
# LOGIC: Undeveloped land serves as reserve for future expansion and natural desert ecosystem
# DEPENDENCIES: None
# ASSUMPTIONS: Hot arid climate requires larger buffer zones for dust and heat management
# ASSUMPTIONS: Solar arrays sized to support community energy needs (~100-150 kW ground-mounted)
# ASSUMPTIONS: Housing density ~4 households per hectare (rural Egyptian standard)
