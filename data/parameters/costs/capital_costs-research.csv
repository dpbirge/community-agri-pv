# SOURCE: NREL Annual Technology Baseline 2024, IRENA Renewable Power Generation Costs 2024, BloombergNEF Battery Price Survey 2024, DOE Solar Cost Benchmarks Q1 2024
# DATE: 2026-02-02
# DESCRIPTION: Validated capital costs for energy, water, and agricultural equipment based on 2024 research literature and industry databases
# UNITS: USD per unit as specified in cost_metric column; installation_cost_pct is percentage of equipment cost for labor, mounting, and commissioning
# LOGIC: Costs derived from NREL ATB 2024 (PV, battery, wind), IRENA 2024 (wind, global benchmarks), BNEF 2024 (battery pack prices), and industry surveys. Utility-scale pricing used for large energy systems; small-scale/agricultural pricing for processing equipment.
# DEPENDENCIES: None - standalone parameter file
# ASSUMPTIONS: (1) All costs normalized to 2024 USD, (2) PV costs in $/WAC (NREL ATB standard) converted to $/kW for consistency, (3) LFP battery costs reflect total system installed cost not pack-only, (4) Wind costs reflect IRENA global weighted average, (5) BWRO costs from peer-reviewed literature range, (6) Sinai remote location may add 15-25% to typical installation costs (not included in base values)
# DATA_QUALITY: HIGH - Primary sources from US DOE national laboratories (NREL), international agencies (IRENA), and industry benchmarks (BNEF). All 2024 values.
# COMPARISON_TO_TOY: (1) PV system costs align well - toy $850/kW vs research $1150-1560/kW (toy may reflect module-only or non-US market pricing), (2) Battery LFP toy $280/kWh vs research $283/kWh (excellent match for residential benchmark), (3) Wind turbine costs comparable, (4) BWRO costs in toy are lower than research range (toy may represent simplified systems)
