# SOURCE: NREL Cost of Wind Energy Review 2024, Bergey Windpower field data (Wisconsin Power & Light 5-year study), PNNL Distributed Wind Market Report 2024
# DATE: 2026-02-06
# DESCRIPTION: Research-grade annual operating and maintenance costs for wind turbines matched to wind_turbines-research.csv models
# UNITS: USD per unit as specified in cost_metric column
# LOGIC: NREL benchmark O&M for all distributed wind is $39/kW/yr (2024). Bergey measured O&M dramatically lower ($3.60/kW/yr) due to 4 moving parts and no gearbox. Eocycle direct-drive design expected similar to Bergey. Larger turbines with gearboxes trend toward the benchmark.
# DEPENDENCIES: wind_turbines-research.csv, capital_costs-research.csv
# ASSUMPTIONS: (1) All costs in 2024 USD, (2) Desert environment adds 10-20% to baseline for dust/heat, (3) Bergey measured data from Wisconsin (moderate climate) — Sinai conditions may increase slightly, (4) NREL $39/kW includes insurance and monitoring overhead that may not apply to all installations
# DATA_QUALITY: HIGH for Bergey (5-year measured field study). MEDIUM for Eocycle/50kW class (estimated from NREL benchmarks).
# COMPARISON_TO_TOY: Toy values ($45/$38/$32 per kW/yr) are in the right range for the NREL benchmark ($39/kW/yr) but don't reflect the wide variation between simple direct-drive (Bergey ~$4/kW/yr) and geared machines (~$40/kW/yr).
