# SOURCE: NREL Annual Technology Baseline 2024, IRENA O&M Cost Database, industry benchmarks
# DATE: 2026-02-02
# DESCRIPTION: Annual operating and maintenance costs for energy, water, and agricultural equipment - Community Agri-PV model
# UNITS: USD per unit as specified in cost_metric column
# LOGIC: O&M costs reflect desert environment adjustments (+10-20% for dust, heat stress on equipment). PV cleaning frequency increased for sandy conditions. Wind O&M higher than PV due to mechanical components. Water treatment includes membrane replacement amortized over membrane life.
# DEPENDENCIES: Links to capital_costs-toy.csv for equipment types; links to equipment specifications in data/parameters/equipment/
# ASSUMPTIONS: (1) All costs in 2024 USD, (2) Desert environment increases cleaning and filter replacement frequency, (3) Skilled labor available locally for routine maintenance, (4) Major repairs may require external technicians (included in cost estimates), (5) Consumables (membranes, filters, lubricants) included in O&M costs
