# SOURCE: FAO Irrigation and Drainage Paper 56 + adjustments for hot arid climate
# DATE: YYYY-MM-DD
# DESCRIPTION: Crop coefficients and growing characteristics for 5 crops
# CROPS: tomato, potato, onion, kale, cucumber
# UNITS:
#   - kc_initial: Crop coefficient at planting (dimensionless, 0-1)
#   - kc_mid: Crop coefficient at full canopy/peak growth (dimensionless, 0.8-1.2)
#   - kc_end: Crop coefficient at harvest (dimensionless, 0-1)
#   - root_depth_m: Maximum effective root depth (meters)
#   - season_length_days: Total growing period from planting to harvest (days)
#   - water_stress_sensitivity: High/Medium/Low sensitivity to water stress
# LOGIC: FAO-56 Table 12 values, adjusted for hot arid conditions (higher Kc due to advection)
# DEPENDENCIES: None (reference data)
# ASSUMPTIONS: Drip irrigation, well-managed crops, no water stress under proper irrigation
