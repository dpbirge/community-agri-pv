# SOURCE: FAO Irrigation and Drainage Paper 56 (Table 12) + hot arid adjustments
# DATE: 2026-02-02
# DESCRIPTION: Crop coefficients for 5 crops, adjusted for Sinai Red Sea hot arid climate
# UNITS:
#   - kc_initial: Crop coefficient at planting (dimensionless)
#   - kc_mid: Crop coefficient at full canopy (dimensionless)
#   - kc_end: Crop coefficient at harvest (dimensionless)
#   - root_depth_m: Maximum effective root depth (meters)
#   - season_length_days: Total growing period planting to harvest (days)
#   - water_stress_sensitivity: High/Medium/Low yield sensitivity to water deficit
# LOGIC: FAO-56 base Kc values increased 5-10% for hot arid advection effects
# DEPENDENCIES: None (reference data)
# ASSUMPTIONS: Drip irrigation (90% efficiency), well-managed crops, no salinity stress
