#   - cost_per_kg_per_day_usd: Daily holding cost per kg including space, handling, and energy

#   (canned, dried) have lowest costs under ambient conditions. Climate-controlled costs
#   include refrigeration energy at ~0.10 USD/kWh.
# DEPENDENCIES: spoilage_rates-toy.csv (product types must match)
