# SOURCE: FAO Irrigation and Drainage Paper 56 (Table 11) + crop physiology literature
# DATE: 2026-02-02
# DESCRIPTION: Growth stage durations and water requirements for 5 crops
# UNITS:
#   - stage: Growth stage name (initial/development/mid/late)
#   - duration_days: Days in this stage (integer)
#   - kc: Average crop coefficient for this stage (dimensionless)
#   - water_stress_impact: Yield loss % per 10% water deficit during this stage
# LOGIC: Stage durations from FAO-56 Table 11, adapted for hot arid climate
# DEPENDENCIES: crop_coefficients-toy.csv (season_length_days must match sum of durations)
# ASSUMPTIONS: Linear Kc transition between stages, stress impacts based on crop physiology
