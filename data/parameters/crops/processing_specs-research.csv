# DATE: 2026-02-05
# DESCRIPTION: Research-grade processing parameters for 5 crops across 4 processing types
# UNITS:
#   - energy_kwh_per_kg: Electricity for processing (kWh per kg fresh input)
#   - labor_hours_per_kg: Labor time required (hours per kg fresh input)
#   - weight_loss_pct: Mass lost during processing (percentage of fresh input weight)
#   - value_add_multiplier: Price multiplier of processed product per kg vs fresh product per kg (dimensionless)
#   - processing_time_hours: Time from input to output per batch (hours)
# LOGIC: Weight loss for drying derived from USDA moisture content data using formula:
#   dried_output = (1 - moisture_fresh) / (1 - moisture_dried); weight_loss = 1 - dried_output.
#   Cross-validated against FAO empirical drying ratios (25 lbs fresh → X lbs dried).
#   Value-add multipliers based on Egyptian/international wholesale price ratios for processed vs fresh products.
#   Energy values for drying based on latent heat of vaporization (0.63 kWh/kg water) at 30% dryer efficiency
#   with 40-50% solar thermal contribution in arid Sinai climate. Canning energy from ASABE industrial data
#   scaled for small-scale operations.
# DEPENDENCIES: None (reference data)
# ASSUMPTIONS:
#   - Community-scale processing (not industrial), semi-automated equipment
#   - Solar-assisted drying in hot arid climate (Sinai Peninsula) reduces electrical energy vs pure electric
#   - Canning includes pickling for onion and cucumber (high-acid process, lower retort requirements)
#   - Value-add multipliers reflect Egyptian wholesale/export market conditions
#   - Labor estimates assume semi-manual community operations (4x more labor-intensive than industrial)
#   - Dried product target moisture: tomato 14%, potato 6.5%, onion 5%, kale 8%, cucumber 5%
