# DATE: 2026-02-02
# DESCRIPTION: Processing requirements for 5 crops across 4 processing types
# UNITS:
#   - energy_kwh_per_kg: Electricity for processing (kWh per kg input)
#   - labor_hours_per_kg: Labor time required (hours per kg input)
#   - weight_loss_pct: Mass lost during processing (percentage of input weight)
#   - value_add_multiplier: Price multiplier vs fresh product (dimensionless)
#   - processing_time_hours: Time from input to output (hours)
# LOGIC: Fresh=baseline, packaged=minimal, canned=moderate, dried=intensive
# DEPENDENCIES: None (reference data)
# ASSUMPTIONS: Modern equipment, efficient operations, bulk processing scale
