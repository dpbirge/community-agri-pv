# DATE: 2026-02-06
# DESCRIPTION: FAO yield response factors (Ky) for water stress calculations (toy dataset)
# UNITS: ky_whole_season (dimensionless) — yield sensitivity to water deficit
# LOGIC: Y_actual = Y_potential × (1 - Ky × (1 - ET_actual / ET_crop))
# DEPENDENCIES: None (reference data)
# ASSUMPTIONS: Simplified values for testing and development
