# SOURCE: Typical financing structures for community infrastructure projects in developing regions (toy estimates)
# DATE: 2026-02-05
# DESCRIPTION: Financial parameters for infrastructure financing categories determining CAPEX and OPEX cost allocation to the community
# UNITS: capex_cost_multiplier (fraction 0-1), has_debt_service (boolean), loan_term_years (years), interest_rate (annual fraction 0-1), opex_cost_multiplier (fraction 0-1)
# LOGIC: Each financing_status represents a complete profile. capex_cost_multiplier=0 means community pays no capital cost (grant or loan covers it). has_debt_service=true adds loan repayment obligations. opex_cost_multiplier=0 means donor covers O&M (grant_full only).
# DEPENDENCIES: Referenced by all equipment subsystems via financing_status field in settings.yaml
# ASSUMPTIONS: Loan terms and interest rates reflect typical development finance for community-scale infrastructure. Concessional loans assume development bank rates (3.5%). Standard loans assume commercial bank rates (6%).
