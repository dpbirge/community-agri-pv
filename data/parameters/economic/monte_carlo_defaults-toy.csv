# Monte Carlo Default Variation Ranges
# =====================================
# Coefficient of variation (CV) for each stochastic parameter used in Monte Carlo simulation.
# CV = standard_deviation / mean, where mean is 1.0 (the baseline multiplier).
# A single CV value means the distribution is symmetric around the mean.
# A range (cv_low, cv_high) allows asymmetric sampling bounds in future extensions.
#
# Fields:
# - parameter: Stochastic parameter name used as dict key in simulation code
# - cv_low: Low end of CV range (currently equal to cv_high for symmetric distributions)
# - cv_high: High end of CV range (currently equal to cv_low for symmetric distributions)
# - category: Parameter grouping (input_price, crop_price, yield)
# - description: Brief explanation of the parameter and its volatility basis
