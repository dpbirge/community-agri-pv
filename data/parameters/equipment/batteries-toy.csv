# SOURCE: Synthetic data based on NREL ATB 2024, IRENA battery cost reports, manufacturer specifications (Tesla, BYD, LG Chem)
# DATE: 2026-02-03
# DESCRIPTION: Battery energy storage system specifications for microgrid applications
# UNITS: capacity_kwh (kWh), power_kw (kW), round_trip_efficiency (decimal), cycle_life (cycles), depth_of_discharge_pct (%), lifespan_years (years), capital_cost_per_kwh (USD/kWh)
# LOGIC: Lithium iron phosphate (LFP) chosen for hot climate tolerance and safety. Cycle life based on 80% depth of discharge. Power rating assumes 4-hour discharge duration. Costs decrease with larger units due to economies of scale.
# DEPENDENCIES: None
# ASSUMPTIONS: Hot desert environment reduces cycle life by ~10% vs temperate; includes battery management system; flow battery included as alternative for longer duration storage
