# SOURCE: Synthetic data based on IEEE reliability standards, NREL O&M reports, manufacturer MTBF data adjusted for desert conditions
# DATE: 2026-02-02
# DESCRIPTION: Equipment failure rates and maintenance parameters for hot, dusty desert environment
# UNITS: mtbf_hours (hours), failure_probability_per_year (decimal), repair_cost_usd (USD), downtime_days (days), maintenance_interval_days (days)
# LOGIC: MTBF values are conservative for harsh desert conditions (high heat, dust, humidity variations). Failure probability = 8760 / MTBF. Maintenance intervals shortened vs manufacturer recommendations due to environment.
# DEPENDENCIES: None
# ASSUMPTIONS: Hot dusty desert reduces MTBF by 25-40% vs temperate climate; repair costs include parts and labor; downtime includes parts sourcing time for remote location
