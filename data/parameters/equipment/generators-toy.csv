# SOURCE: Synthetic data based on diesel generator manufacturer specifications, generator efficiency studies, Egyptian fuel prices
# DATE: 2026-02-03
# DESCRIPTION: Diesel backup generator specifications for small-scale community microgrid
# UNITS: generator_type (string), capacity_kw (kW), fuel_consumption_l_per_kwh (L/kWh), efficiency (decimal), min_load_pct (%), startup_time_min (minutes)
# LOGIC: Fuel consumption varies with load factor - higher loads more efficient. Typical diesel generators 30-40% efficient. Minimum load ~30% to prevent engine damage. Startup time 2-5 minutes for small generators.
# DEPENDENCIES: None
# ASSUMPTIONS: Backup power for critical loads; diesel fuel available in Egypt; small-scale community microgrid (50-200 kW); costs in 2024 USD; fuel consumption at 75% load factor
# CONTEXT: Location: Sinai Peninsula, Egypt. Use case: Backup power for critical loads. Fuel: Diesel (available in Egypt). Scale: Small-scale community microgrid (50-200 kW).
