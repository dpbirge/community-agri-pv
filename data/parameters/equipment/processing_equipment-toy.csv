# SOURCE: Synthetic data based on FAO agricultural processing guides, equipment manufacturer catalogs
# DATE: 2026-02-02
# DESCRIPTION: Food processing equipment specifications for small-scale agricultural community
# UNITS: capacity_kg_per_day (kg/day), energy_kw_continuous (kW), capital_cost_usd (USD), maintenance_cost_per_year_usd (USD/year), lifespan_years (years)
# LOGIC: Packaged (washing, sorting, boxing) has lowest energy; canned (heating, sealing) moderate; dried (dehydration) highest energy but extends shelf life significantly. Capacities sized for 10-20% of peak daily harvest from 500 ha operation.
# DEPENDENCIES: None
# ASSUMPTIONS: All costs in 2024 USD; equipment suitable for hot climate operation; includes basic refrigeration for packaged line
