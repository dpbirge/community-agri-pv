# SOURCE: Synthetic data based on NREL ATB 2024, IEA PVPS, and manufacturer specifications
# DATE: 2026-02-02
# DESCRIPTION: PV system specifications for agri-PV installation at 3 density levels
# UNITS: ground_coverage_pct (%), module_efficiency (decimal), temp_coefficient_per_c (decimal/C), system_losses_pct (%), degradation_rate_per_year (decimal/year), tilt_angle_deg (degrees), azimuth_deg (degrees), panel_height_m (meters), lifespan_years (years)
# LOGIC: All variants use same polycrystalline panels; density affects ground coverage and microclimate effects. Tilt optimized for 28N latitude. System losses include wiring, inverter, soiling, and mismatch losses.
# DEPENDENCIES: None
# ASSUMPTIONS: Fixed-tilt south-facing installation; 3.0m clearance for agricultural equipment; hot desert environment increases soiling losses slightly
