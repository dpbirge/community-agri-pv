# SOURCE: Synthetic data based on DOE desalination databases, membrane manufacturer specifications (Dow FILMTEC, Toray)
# DATE: 2026-02-02
# DESCRIPTION: Brackish water reverse osmosis (BWRO) treatment specifications for 3 salinity levels
# UNITS: tds_ppm (mg/L), energy_kwh_per_m3 (kWh/m3), membrane_life_months (months), recovery_rate_pct (%), capital_cost_per_m3_day (USD per m3/day capacity), maintenance_cost_per_m3 (USD/m3)
# LOGIC: Higher salinity requires more energy for desalination and reduces membrane life. Recovery rate decreases with salinity to prevent scaling. Capital costs based on small-scale BWRO plants (100-500 m3/day).
# DEPENDENCIES: None
# ASSUMPTIONS: Hot desert environment reduces membrane life by ~20% vs temperate climate; costs include pre-treatment and post-treatment
