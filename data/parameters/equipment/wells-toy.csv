# SOURCE: Synthetic data based on FAO irrigation guides, Egyptian well drilling cost databases, pump manufacturer specifications
# DATE: 2026-02-03
# DESCRIPTION: Groundwater well specifications for brackish water extraction in Sinai Peninsula
# UNITS: well_depth_m (meters), flow_rate_m3_day (m3/day), capital_cost_per_well (USD), om_cost_per_year (USD/year)
# LOGIC: Pumping energy is now calculated from first principles in calculations.py using hydraulic engineering formulas (lift + friction losses). Deeper wells have higher capital costs (drilling, casing) and higher O&M (pump maintenance, cleaning).
# DEPENDENCIES: None
# ASSUMPTIONS: Brackish groundwater (density ~1025 kg/m3); submersible electric pumps; costs in 2024 USD; small-scale community wells (10-20 wells per community); typical Sinai Peninsula depths 30-100m; flow rates suitable for community irrigation needs
# CONTEXT: Location: Sinai Peninsula, Egypt. Water type: Brackish groundwater. Scale: Community wells. Typical depth: 30-100 meters. Typical flow: 50-200 m3/day per well.
