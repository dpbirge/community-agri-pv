# SOURCE: Synthetic data based on small wind turbine manufacturer specifications (Bergey, Xzeres, Enercon)
# DATE: 2026-02-02
# DESCRIPTION: Wind turbine specifications for 3 microgrid-scale turbine sizes
# UNITS: rated_capacity_kw (kW), cut_in_speed_ms (m/s), rated_speed_ms (m/s), cut_out_speed_ms (m/s), hub_height_m (meters), rotor_diameter_m (meters), capacity_factor_typical (decimal), lifespan_years (years)
# LOGIC: Small turbines have lower cut-in speeds for light wind operation; larger turbines have better efficiency in strong winds. Capacity factors based on moderate wind regime (3-5 m/s average).
# DEPENDENCIES: None
# ASSUMPTIONS: Moderate wind resource typical of Sinai coastal areas; capacity factors conservative for hot dusty environment
