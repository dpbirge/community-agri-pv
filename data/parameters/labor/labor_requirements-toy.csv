# DESCRIPTION: Labor requirements by activity type for small-scale agricultural operations in Sinai, Egypt.
#              Values represent manual/semi-mechanized operations typical of a 500 ha community farm system.
# UNITS: hours_per_unit as specified per unit type (per_hectare, per_kg, per_day, per_equipment)
# LOGIC: Labor hours derived from FAO benchmarks for developing countries with manual/semi-mechanized operations.
#        Field work hours based on Gezira scheme data (Sudan) and adapted for Egyptian conditions.
#        Processing labor from small-scale food processing benchmarks.
# DEPENDENCIES: None
# ASSUMPTIONS: Semi-mechanized field operations (tractor for tillage, manual planting/harvesting).
#              Labor hours assume experienced workers in hot arid climate conditions.
#              Processing activities occur in covered facilities.
#              40-hour standard work week for planning purposes.
