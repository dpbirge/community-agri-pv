# DESCRIPTION: Labor wage rates by worker category for agricultural operations in Egypt - Research data
#              based on empirical sources including government minimum wage decrees, CAPMAS surveys, and salary databases.
# UNITS: usd_per_hour (US dollars), egp_per_hour_original (Egyptian pounds), typical_hours_per_week (hours)
# LOGIC: Base wages derived from Egyptian minimum wage progression (EGP 6,000/month May 2024, EGP 7,000/month March 2025).
#        Private sector minimum wage for 2024 = EGP 6,000/month, which at 48 hours/week (208 hours/month) = EGP 28.85/hour.
#        The NCW established minimum hourly wage for part-time workers at EGP 28/hour in 2025.
#        Farm worker average per ERI data: EGP 60/hour (EGP 124,228/year at 2,070 hours). General laborers average: EGP 53/hour.
#        Skill premiums applied: unskilled (1.0x minimum), semi-skilled (1.3-1.6x), skilled (1.8-2.5x).
#        Manager/supervisor wages from WorldSalaries Agricultural Manager data (EGP 161,600/year median).
#        Equipment operator wages from SalaryExpert heavy equipment data (EGP 182,799/year, EGP 88/hour).
#        Driver wages from SalaryExplorer courier/transport sector (EGP 5,380/month typical, ~EGP 25/hour).
#        Quality inspector from SalaryExplorer QC sector (EGP 8,720/month typical, ~EGP 42/hour).
#        Maintenance technician from SalaryExplorer facilities/maintenance (EGP 5,980/month typical, ~EGP 29/hour).
# DEPENDENCIES: None
# ASSUMPTIONS: Wages are gross hourly rates before deductions. Agricultural sector wages in rural Egypt are typically
#              at or slightly above minimum wage for unskilled work, with premium for specialized skills.
#              Informal sector and seasonal workers may earn less than formal sector rates shown here.
#              Work weeks vary by season and role. Year-round workers average 40-48 hours/week.
#              Seasonal harvesters may work 50-60 hours/week during peak periods.
#              Rural agricultural wages are typically 15-25% lower than urban industrial wages for comparable skill levels.
#              Exchange rate uses 2024 average of 45.33 EGP/USD (World Bank/exchange-rates.org data).
# DATA_QUALITY: MODERATE. Minimum wage data is official and reliable. Occupation-specific wages from salary databases
#               (ERI, SalaryExplorer) may skew toward formal sector and urban employment. CAPMAS surveys exclude informal
#               agricultural workers outside formal establishments. Farm-specific wage data is limited; estimates interpolated
#               from general labor categories. Regional wage variation (rural vs urban) not fully captured.
# COMPARISON_TO_TOY: Research data shows similar ranges to toy data ($1.00-$2.65/hour in toy vs $0.84-$2.42/hour in research).
#                    Key differences: (1) Research uses minimum wage floor of EGP 28/hour as baseline rather than EGP 45/hour,
#                    (2) Seasonal harvester rate slightly lower reflecting informal sector realities,
#                    (3) Manager rate slightly lower based on agricultural manager salary data vs general skilled premium,
#                    (4) Overall range is comparable, validating toy data reasonableness.
