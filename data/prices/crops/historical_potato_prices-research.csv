# DESCRIPTION: Annual Egyptian potato prices (farmgate, wholesale, retail) with EGP original values and USD conversion
# UNITS: usd_per_kg (USD/kg), egp_per_kg (Egyptian pounds/kg), exchange rate (EGP per USD)
# LOGIC: Prices derived from export data and CEIC wholesale records. Farmgate = ~60-70% of wholesale; Retail = ~150-180% of wholesale. Potato is Egypt's second most important vegetable crop.
# DEPENDENCIES: USD/EGP exchange rates from World Bank; CEIC historical wholesale data (2015-2016 in EGP)
# ASSUMPTIONS: Egypt produces ~6.87M tonnes (2023 FAO). 0.177M hectares, 29.29 tons/ha yield. Two main seasons with price seasonality. Export prices higher than domestic wholesale.
# DATA_QUALITY: High. CEIC provides verified wholesale EGP data (2015-2016). SelinaWamucii export prices (2017-2021) well-documented. Tridge confirms recent wholesale ranges.
# COMPARISON_TO_TOY: Research shows lower prices than toy data. Toy range $0.49-$0.76/kg; research range $0.25-$0.55/kg wholesale. Egyptian domestic prices significantly below export prices due to oversupply.
