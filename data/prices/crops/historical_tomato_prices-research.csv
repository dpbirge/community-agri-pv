# DATE: 2026-02-02
# DESCRIPTION: Annual Egyptian tomato prices (farmgate, wholesale, retail) with EGP original values and USD conversion
# UNITS: usd_per_kg (USD/kg), egp_per_kg (Egyptian pounds/kg), exchange rate (EGP per USD)
# LOGIC: Prices derived from export price trends, wholesale market data, and retail markup ratios. Farmgate = ~50-60% of wholesale; Retail = ~150-200% of wholesale. Seasonal averages used for annual data.
# DEPENDENCIES: USD/EGP exchange rates from World Bank and xe.com historical data
# ASSUMPTIONS: Egypt is major tomato producer (7.8 Tg annually). Price volatility reflects seasonal harvests (Mar-May, Sep-Nov low prices). 2022-2024 prices affected by EGP devaluation and inflation.
# DATA_QUALITY: Medium-High. Export prices from SelinaWamucii (2017-2024) well-documented. Wholesale prices from Tridge verified against CAPMAS. Earlier years (2015-2016) extrapolated from trends.
# COMPARISON_TO_TOY: Research prices show higher volatility and clearer currency effects. Toy data range $0.63-$1.20/kg wholesale; research range $0.35-$0.95/kg wholesale reflecting actual Egyptian market (lower than global average). Post-2022 EGP prices much higher due to devaluation.
