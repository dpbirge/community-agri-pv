# DESCRIPTION: Historical diesel pump prices in Egypt from 2012-2024, documenting fuel subsidy reform
#   phases and currency devaluations. Prices are official government-regulated pump prices for diesel
#   (known locally as "Solar" or "Mazout").
# UNITS: usd_per_liter (USD per liter at period exchange rate), egp_per_liter_original (Egyptian Pounds
#   per liter - official pump price), usd_egp_exchange_rate (EGP per 1 USD, period average)
# LOGIC: Egypt's fuel subsidy reform occurred in distinct phases:
#   Phase 1 (Pre-2014): Heavy subsidies, diesel at EGP 1.10/L since 2008
#   Phase 2 (July 2014): First major reform - 64% price increase to EGP 1.80/L under IMF pressure
#   Phase 3 (Nov 2016): Currency floatation (EGP 8.88 to ~18/USD), diesel raised to EGP 2.35/L
#   Phase 4 (June 2017): Further subsidy cuts, diesel to EGP 3.65/L
#   Phase 5 (June 2018): Diesel to EGP 5.50/L
#   Phase 6 (July 2019): Final pre-COVID cut, diesel to EGP 6.75/L, automatic pricing introduced
#   Phase 7 (2020-2021): Prices held stable despite oil volatility (COVID period)
#   Phase 8 (July 2022): First increase in 3 years to EGP 7.25/L (Ukraine war impact)
#   Phase 9 (May 2023): Diesel to EGP 8.25/L
#   Phase 10 (Mar 2024): Currency floatation (30 to 50 EGP/USD), diesel to EGP 10.00/L
#   Phase 11 (July 2024): Diesel to EGP 11.50/L
#   Phase 12 (Oct 2024): Diesel to EGP 13.50/L
# DEPENDENCIES: None
# ASSUMPTIONS:
#   1. Exchange rates are period averages from Central Bank of Egypt / World Bank data
#   2. Dates represent effective date of price changes; prices valid until next change
#   3. Pre-2014 data interpolated from energypedia historical records
#   4. Agricultural diesel uses same pump price (no separate agricultural pricing after 2014)
#   5. Prices represent urban pump prices; may vary slightly by region
#   6. 2020-2021 prices assumed stable based on quarterly review reports showing no changes
# DATA_QUALITY: MODERATE-HIGH
#   - Official government-announced prices verified against multiple sources
#   - Exchange rates from Central Bank of Egypt and World Bank official data
#   - Some interpolation required for months between price announcements
#   - USD calculations derived from EGP prices and period exchange rates
# COMPARISON_TO_TOY: Toy data uses monthly granularity with modulated prices based on global oil.
#   Research data uses actual government-announced prices at change dates. Key differences:
#   - Toy: EGP 2.90-3.16 in 2015 vs Research: EGP 1.80 (subsidy still heavy)
#   - Toy: Smooth monthly variation vs Research: Step changes at policy announcements
#   - Toy: Exchange rates roughly match but not identical
#   - Research file confirms subsidy reform was more dramatic than toy assumptions
