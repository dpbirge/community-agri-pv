# DESCRIPTION: Historical electricity tariffs for agricultural/irrigation users in Egypt (2015-2024), based on official EgyptERA tariff schedules and news reports documenting tariff changes during Egypt's subsidy removal program
# UNITS: date (YYYY-MM-DD), usd_per_kwh_offpeak (USD), usd_per_kwh_peak (USD), usd_per_kwh_avg_daily (USD), rate_schedule (standard/summer), egp_per_kwh_original (Egyptian Pounds), usd_egp_exchange_rate (EGP per USD)
# LOGIC: Agricultural/irrigation tariffs at low voltage (380V) from EgyptERA. Peak/off-peak differentials derived from medium voltage agricultural rates (1.5x ratio for peak, 0.92x for off-peak based on Jan 2024 MV agricultural rates showing 177.6/118.4 pt ratio). USD conversion uses annual average exchange rates from World Bank/Central Bank of Egypt. Tariff changes applied at fiscal year boundaries (July 1) or documented change dates.
# DEPENDENCIES: None
# ASSUMPTIONS: (1) Agricultural rates represent low-voltage irrigation users at 380V connection; (2) Peak/off-peak differential ratio of ~1.5 for peak and ~0.92 for off-peak derived from Jan 2024 MV agricultural schedule; (3) Pre-2024 agricultural rates estimated from tariff progression documentation showing ~28-42% annual increases during reform; (4) Exchange rates use annual period averages; (5) Agricultural sector receives preferential rates compared to commercial (~15% discount historically)
# DATA_QUALITY: MODERATE - Aug 2024 tariff HIGH confidence (200 pt/kWh directly from EgyptERA for LV agricultural); Jan 2024 MV agricultural HIGH confidence (128.3 pt avg, 118.4 off-peak, 177.6 peak from EgyptERA); 2019-2023 MODERATE confidence (news sources + reform program documentation); 2015-2018 LOWER confidence (estimated from reform progression and available commercial/residential data)
# COMPARISON_TO_TOY: Key differences from toy data: (1) Research confirms Aug 2024 agricultural rate of 200 pt/kWh = 2.0 EGP, toy shows ~4.87-5.02 EGP - toy appears to use higher consumption tier or different category; (2) Research USD rates generally lower (0.03-0.08 USD) vs toy (0.05-0.10 USD); (3) Exchange rate progression matches well; (4) Both show subsidy removal trend but toy has more aggressive EGP rate increases
# TARIFF_REFORM_TIMELINE: PM Decree 1257/2014 began subsidy removal; Original 5-year plan (2014-2019) extended to 8 years after Nov 2016 float; Decree 100/2020 extended to 2024-2025 due to COVID-19; July 2024 ended tariff freeze; Aug 2024 14-50% increases implemented
# KEY_2024_TARIFFS_VERIFIED: LV Agricultural 200 pt/kWh (Aug 2024); MV Agricultural avg 128.3 pt/kWh, off-peak 118.4, peak 177.6 (Jan 2024); Industrial flat rate 233 pt/kWh
