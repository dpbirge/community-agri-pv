# DESCRIPTION: Historical electricity tariffs for commercial/industrial users in Egypt (2015-2024), derived from agricultural rates with 16.5% markup to reflect full-cost commercial pricing
# UNITS: date (YYYY-MM-DD), usd_per_kwh_offpeak (USD), usd_per_kwh_peak (USD), usd_per_kwh_avg_daily (USD), rate_schedule (standard), egp_per_kwh_original (Egyptian Pounds), usd_egp_exchange_rate (EGP per USD)
# SEASONAL_NOTE: Egyptian commercial/industrial electricity tariffs do NOT have seasonal (summer/winter) rate variations per EgyptERA official tariff schedules.
# LOGIC: Agricultural/irrigation tariffs (200 pt/kWh Aug 2024) increased by 16.5% to match industrial flat rate (233 pt/kWh Aug 2024). Peak/off-peak differentials maintained from agricultural schedule. Represents unsubsidized full-cost-recovery pricing for communities without agricultural electricity access.
# DEPENDENCIES: Derived from historical_grid_electricity_prices-research.csv (subsidized agricultural rates)
# ASSUMPTIONS: (1) Commercial/industrial rates are consistently 16.5% higher than agricultural across all years; (2) Peak/off-peak ratio structure remains the same as agricultural; (3) Exchange rates identical to agricultural dataset
# DATA_QUALITY: MODERATE - Based on verified Aug 2024 differential between agricultural (200 pt) and industrial (233 pt) rates; historical markup ratio assumed constant
# COMPARISON_TO_SUBSIDIZED: Unsubsidized rates are 1.165x subsidized agricultural rates, reflecting removal of agricultural electricity subsidy
# TARIFF_REFORM_TIMELINE: Same as agricultural tariffs - PM Decree 1257/2014 began subsidy removal; extended to 2024-2025 due to COVID-19; Aug 2024 increases implemented
# KEY_2024_TARIFFS_VERIFIED: Industrial flat rate 233 pt/kWh (Aug 2024) = 1.165x agricultural 200 pt/kWh
