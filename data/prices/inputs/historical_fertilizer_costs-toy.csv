# SOURCE: Synthetic data based on Egyptian agricultural input cost surveys, FAO GIEWS,
#   World Bank Fertilizer Price Index, CAPMAS agricultural production cost bulletins
# DATE: 2026-02-05
# DESCRIPTION: Annual fertilizer costs per hectare for irrigated vegetable farming in
#   arid regions of Egypt. Covers NPK compound fertilizers, urea, and micronutrients
#   typical for drip-irrigated vegetable production in Sinai-like conditions.
# UNITS: usd_per_ha (USD per hectare per growing season), egp_per_ha_original (Egyptian
#   Pounds per hectare), usd_egp_exchange_rate (EGP per 1 USD, period average)
# LOGIC: Egyptian fertilizer costs reflect three overlapping trends:
#   1. Domestic subsidy reduction under IMF structural adjustment (2016-2019)
#   2. Currency devaluations (Nov 2016 float, Jan 2023 float, Mar 2024 float)
#   3. Global fertilizer price shock from Ukraine war (2022 peak, gradual decline)
#   Costs rose from ~$220/ha (2015, heavy subsidies) to ~$380/ha (2022 peak),
#   then moderated slightly as global prices eased despite continued EGP weakness.
# DEPENDENCIES: None
# ASSUMPTIONS:
#   1. Costs represent typical NPK + urea + micronutrient package for vegetable crops
#   2. Application rates based on Egyptian Ministry of Agriculture recommendations
#   3. Prices include delivery to farm gate in Sinai region
#   4. Exchange rates are annual averages from Central Bank of Egypt
#   5. Single annual value used (fertilizer purchases typically seasonal)
# DATA_QUALITY: LOW (synthetic/toy data for model development)
# GENERATION_METHOD: Manual estimation based on published cost surveys and global indices
