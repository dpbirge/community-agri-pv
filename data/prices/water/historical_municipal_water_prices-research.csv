# DESCRIPTION: Historical municipal water tariffs for Egypt showing tiered residential pricing structure (2015-2024)
# UNITS: date (YYYY-01-01 annual), usd_per_m3_tier1/2/3 (USD per cubic meter), egp_per_m3_original_tier1/2/3 (Egyptian Pounds per cubic meter), usd_egp_exchange_rate (EGP per 1 USD)
# LOGIC: Egypt uses tiered (progressive) water pricing to incentivize conservation. Tier 1 (0-10 m3/month) is lowest rate for low-income protection.
#        Tier 2 (11-20 m3/month) is mid-consumption. Tier 3 (21-30 m3/month) represents moderate-high consumption.
#        Additional tiers exist (31-40 m3 and >40 m3) but Tier 3 is representative upper bound for typical residential/small agricultural use.
#        Sewage surcharge (not included in rates) was 57% pre-2017, 63% in 2017, 75% from 2018 onward.
# DEPENDENCIES: None
# ASSUMPTIONS: 1) Agricultural Nile irrigation water is historically FREE or near-free to Egyptian farmers (subsidized by government);
#              2) Municipal water rates apply to rural communities using piped water, not gravity-fed Nile irrigation;
#              3) For Sinai Peninsula communities using groundwater/desalination, costs may be higher than municipal rates;
#              4) Rates shown are official tariffs; some governorates reported 2-3x higher effective bills in 2024 due to implementation changes;
#              5) Exchange rates are annual averages from World Bank/Central Bank of Egypt;
#              6) Rates for 2019-2023 are extrapolated based on 2018 tariffs (no official increases announced until 2024);
#              7) For brackish groundwater desalination in Sinai, costs range $0.50-1.00/m3 vs municipal rates.
# DATA_QUALITY: MODERATE - Official tariff data confirmed for 2014-2018 from Egyptian Official Gazette and news sources.
#               Rates for 2019-2023 are held constant at 2018 levels as no documented tariff changes were found.
#               2024 data reflects reported 2-3x bill increases but official new tariff structure not published.
#               Exchange rates are well-documented from World Bank data.
# COMPARISON_TO_TOY: Toy data shows agricultural_bulk category with USD $0.19-0.75/m3 range (2015-2024).
#                    Research shows municipal Tier 1 at $0.03-0.06/m3 (much lower) and Tier 3 at $0.09-0.15/m3.
#                    Discrepancy explained: Toy data may represent total cost including pumping/infrastructure for bulk agricultural users,
#                    while research reflects subsidized municipal tariffs which are among world's lowest.
#                    Desalination cost ($0.50-1.00/m3) more closely matches toy data upper range - appropriate for Sinai groundwater scenario.
