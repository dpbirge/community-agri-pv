# DESCRIPTION: Submersible and surface pump profiles for brackish groundwater extraction and water transfer in hot-arid community systems
# UNITS: pump_type (string), max_depth_m (meters), rated_flow_m3_hr (m3/hr), pump_efficiency (fraction), motor_kw (kW), capital_cost (USD), om_cost_per_year (USD/year)
# LOGIC: Efficiency reflects combined pump+motor for submersible centrifugal pumps in brackish water. Larger pumps handle deeper wells but at lower efficiency due to increased friction and shaft losses. Surface booster pumps are used for horizontal transfer (well-to-treatment, treatment-to-storage, storage-to-field) with higher efficiency since no lift losses. Motor kW sized for rated flow at max depth with ~10-15% headroom.
# MOTOR VALIDATION: motor_kw >= (density * g * max_depth * rated_flow / 3600) / efficiency.
#   small: (1025*9.81*50*5/3600)/0.62 = 1128 W -> 1.5 kW motor (33% headroom)
#   medium: (1025*9.81*100*10/3600)/0.58 = 4820 W -> 5.5 kW motor (14% headroom)
#   large: (1025*9.81*150*18/3600)/0.55 = 13724 W -> 15.0 kW motor (9% headroom)
#   deep: (1025*9.81*200*15/3600)/0.50 = 16760 W -> 18.5 kW motor (10% headroom)
# DEPENDENCIES: Referenced by pump_type in settings/water_systems.yaml
# ASSUMPTIONS: Brackish water density ~1025 kg/m3; PVC rising main; costs in 2024 USD; includes motor, cable, and basic controls; O&M includes impeller/seal replacement and annual servicing
# NOTES: Select pump where max_depth_m >= well_depth. Booster pumps handle horizontal pipe runs only (no lift). Simulation reads pump_type from water_systems.yaml and looks up efficiency and flow rate here.
