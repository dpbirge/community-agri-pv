# DESCRIPTION: Water treatment energy consumption lookup for BWRO systems at 7 TDS bands. Provides min/typical/max energy ranges, recovery rates, and brine production. Simplified version of water_treatment-research.csv for quick estimation.
# UNITS: tds_band (categorical), tds_ppm_midpoint (mg/L), energy_kwh_per_m3_min/typical/max (kWh/m³ product water), recovery_rate_pct (%), brine_disposal_m3_per_m3_product (m³ brine per m³ product)
# LOGIC: Energy increases with feedwater TDS due to higher osmotic pressure. Recovery rates decrease with TDS to prevent membrane scaling. Brine volume = (1/recovery_fraction) - 1. Energy ranges reflect variation in system age, temperature, and membrane condition.
# DEPENDENCIES: None (standalone reference table)
# ASSUMPTIONS: Single-pass BWRO with energy recovery devices (ERDs) for bands above 5000 ppm; target permeate TDS <500 ppm; operating temperature 25-30C; membrane age 0-3 years
