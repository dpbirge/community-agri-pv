# DESCRIPTION: Brackish water reverse osmosis (BWRO) treatment specifications at 12 TDS bands - research-validated parameters with finer resolution for accurate lookup-based simulation
# UNITS: tds_ppm (mg/L), energy_kwh_per_m3 (kWh/m³ product water), membrane_life_months (months), recovery_rate_pct (%), capital_cost_per_m3_day (USD per m³/day capacity), maintenance_cost_per_m3 (USD/m³)
# LOGIC: Energy consumption scales with TDS due to osmotic pressure (~0.7 psi per 100 ppm TDS for NaCl equivalent). Recovery rate decreases with TDS to prevent membrane scaling (CaCO3, CaSO4, silica). At ~15,000 ppm, system approaches SWRO territory requiring higher-pressure membranes. Intermediate bands interpolated using SEC = (feed_pressure * Q_feed) / (Q_permeate * pump_eff * ERD_eff) relationship. Membrane life decreases with TDS due to increased fouling and chemical cleaning frequency.
# DEPENDENCIES: None
# ASSUMPTIONS: Hot arid environment (Egypt/Sinai) reduces membrane life ~15-20% vs temperate baseline. Small-scale systems (100-500 m³/day capacity). Costs include pre-treatment (cartridge filtration, antiscalant dosing) and post-treatment (remineralization). No ERD for <3000 ppm; ERD optional 3000-8000 ppm; ERD required >8000 ppm. USD 2024 equivalent values.
# DATA_QUALITY: Research-grade. Anchor points at 2000, 6000, 15000 ppm from peer-reviewed literature. Intermediate bands interpolated using BWRO thermodynamic relationships and validated against manufacturer performance curves (DuPont BW30, Toray TMG).
# SNAP_LOGIC: Simulation snaps input TDS to nearest band. Max interpolation error with 12 bands: ~500 ppm in low range, ~1250 ppm in high range. Previous 3-band version had up to 6500 ppm gaps.

# KEY RESEARCH FINDINGS:
# - BWRO energy: 0.5-2.5 kWh/m³ typical range (vs SWRO 2.5-5.4 kWh/m³)
# - At 2000 ppm: ~0.5-1.0 kWh/m³ achievable with 80-85% recovery
# - At 5000-6000 ppm: ~1.5 kWh/m³ with 65-75% recovery
# - At 10,000-15,000 ppm: approaching SWRO territory, 2.5-3.5 kWh/m³, recovery 50-65%
# - Membrane life: 2-5 years typical, 24-36 months for brackish in hot climates
# - OPEX: $0.39-0.66/m³ for large plants; $0.60-1.18/m³ for small-scale
# - CAPEX: $500-2947/m³/day depending on capacity, location, water quality
