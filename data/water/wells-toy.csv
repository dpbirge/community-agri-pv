# DESCRIPTION: Groundwater well specifications for brackish water extraction in Sinai Peninsula with depth-correlated TDS
# UNITS: well_depth_m (meters), flow_rate_m3_day (m3/day), tds_ppm (mg/L), capital_cost_per_well (USD), om_cost_per_year (USD/year)
# LOGIC: Deeper wells access older, more mineralized aquifer layers with higher TDS. Sinai brackish aquifers typically show 50-80 ppm TDS increase per meter of depth below ~20m. Capital and O&M costs scale with depth (drilling, casing, pump maintenance). Pumping energy is calculated from first principles using hydraulic formulas (density * gravity * head * volume / efficiency), not stored here.
# DEPENDENCIES: Pumping energy calculation requires pump_systems-toy.csv for pump efficiency
# ASSUMPTIONS: Brackish groundwater (density ~1025 kg/m3); submersible electric pumps; costs in 2024 USD; small-scale community wells; Sinai Peninsula depths 10-120m; TDS values represent typical central Sinai Nubian sandstone aquifer conditions where salinity increases with depth and distance from recharge zones
# CONTEXT: Location: Sinai Peninsula, Egypt. Aquifer: Nubian sandstone (brackish). TDS range: 1000-8000 ppm typical. Shallow wells (10-20m) access near-recharge zones with lower mineralization. Deeper wells reach more saline layers but may access higher-yield zones.
