# Community Farm Modeling Specifications

## 1. Overview

### Primary goal

This document defines the configuration schema and policy structure for the community farm simulation model. It serves as the single source of truth for what parameters exist, their valid options, and how they organize into a complete simulation scenario.

There are two main sections: system configurations (static initial conditions) and policies (rule-sets governing simulation behavior). For detailed policy rule-sets and pseudocode, see `docs/architecture/policies.md`. For calculation methodologies and formulas, see `docs/architecture/calculations.md`.

## 2. System configurations

System configurations are static settings that describe initial conditions for a given simulation.

Configuration parameters are in the form:
**Category**
- parameter_name [list of options] (clarifying notes) TODO: Notes to guide refactoring or new functionality

When units are obvious, they should be appended to the end of the parameter. E.g. community_area_km2

### System Financing

All community-owned systems include a `financing_status` parameter that indicates the financial profile for capital costs (CAPEX) and operating costs (OPEX).

**Financing status options:** [existing_owned, grant_full, grant_capex, purchased_cash, loan_standard, loan_concessional]

**Profiles:**
- `existing_owned`: Already owned/depreciated assets, O&M costs only
- `grant_full`: Grant covers CAPEX and O&M, no community cost
- `grant_capex`: Grant covers CAPEX, community pays O&M
- `purchased_cash`: Community paid cash for CAPEX, pays O&M
- `loan_standard`: Standard commercial loan, community pays debt service + O&M
- `loan_concessional`: Below-market development loan, pays debt service + O&M

**Note:** Financial parameters (interest rates, loan terms, cost multipliers) for each profile are defined in `data/parameters/economic/financing_profiles.csv`.

**Configuration sections use `_system` suffix:** In YAML files, use `water_system`, `energy_system`, and `food_processing_system` as section names.

## 3. Policies

See `policies.md` Section 2 for complete implementation details including context/output dataclass fields, helper methods, pseudocode, and usage examples.

Policy source code is in `src/policies/`

Policies are rule-sets that govern actions within the simulation. Policies are universal logics that can be applied to either farms or the community.

All policy modules follow the same pattern:
- a context dataclass (input)
- a decision/allocation dataclass (output)
- a base class with a `decide()` or `allocate()` method, concrete policy classes
- a registry with a `get_*_policy(name)` factory function. 

### Water policies

Each farm selects a water source allocation strategy. The policy is instantiated during scenario loading and called daily in the simulation loop via `execute_water_policy()`.

| Policy name | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `always_groundwater` | 100% groundwater with onsite desalination; municipal fallback if physically constrained |
| `always_municipal` | 100% municipal water; no treatment energy needed |
| `cheapest_source` | Daily cost comparison: groundwater (pumping + treatment energy cost) vs municipal (marginal tier price) |
| `conserve_groundwater` | Prefers municipal; uses groundwater only when municipal price exceeds a configurable threshold multiplier |
| `quota_enforced` | Hard annual groundwater limit with monthly variance controls; forces 100% municipal when quota exhausted |

**Context → Decision:** `WaterPolicyContext` → `WaterAllocation` (groundwater_m3, municipal_m3, cost_usd, energy_used_kwh)

### Food processing policies

Each farm selects a food processing policy strategy. Determines how harvested crop is split across processing pathways. Called in `process_harvests()` during the simulation loop.

| Policy | Fresh | Packaged | Canned | Dried | Behavior |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `all_fresh` | 100% | 0% | 0% | 0% | Fixed split according to table |
| `maximize_storage` | 20% | 10% | 35% | 35% | Fixed split according to table |
| `balanced` | 50% | 20% | 15% | 15% | Fixed split according to table |
| `market_responsive` | 30-65% | 15-20% | 10-25% | 10-25% | Shifts toward processing when fresh prices fall below 80% of reference farmgate prices |

**Note**: All policies have an umbrella policy that forces the sale of food if storage becomes full OR food has reached it's shelf-life. Each harvest must be tracked as a discrete unit to know first-in, first-out tranches and to ensure no food stays past it's shelf life. When storage becomes full, the older tranche is sold first, then the second tranche, until enough space is made.

**Context → Decision:** `FoodProcessingContext` → `ProcessingAllocation` (fresh_fraction, packaged_fraction, canned_fraction, dried_fraction)

### Market policies (selling)

Each farm selects a sales policy. Food processing policies entirely determine how food is processed (even when based on food prices). Market policies entirely determine when food is sold. The only exception is when food storage runs out and older stored food must be sold to make room for new food.

| Policy name | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `sell_all_immediately` | Once crops are processed into their final state (fresh, canned, etc.) they are immediately sold to market. Storage is only used to hold products before they are sold to market. This allows minimal storage space |
| `hold_for_peak` | Crops are processed according to food processing policy and the max amount is stored until prices are above a certain threshold |
| `adaptive` | Use sigmoid (within range) to determine portion of processed food based on current price relative to historic prices |

TODOS:
- Determine the threshold for `hold_for_peak` that triggers sales
- Determine the sigmoid and min-max band

**Context → Decision:** `MarketPolicyContext` → `MarketDecision` (sell_fraction, store_fraction, process_fraction, target_price_per_kg)

### Energy policies

Each farm selects a energy source allocation strategy. The policy is instantiated during scenario loading and called daily in the simulation loop via `execute_energy_policy()`.

| Policy name | Behavior |
|---|---| 
| `microgrid` | Uses wind and solar sources first with battery buffering, then uses generator. Behaves as if no grid connection. |
| `renewable_first` | Uses wind and solar sources first with battery buffering, then uses grid. Generator only used if grid goes down. |
| `all_grid` | All energy from grid. If renewable sources specified in configuration, solar or wind energy is sold directly to the grid (net metering) |

**Context → Decision:** `EnergyPolicyContext` → `EnergyAllocation`

NOTE: Three dispatch strategies are defined. Currently, `dispatch_energy()` in `simulation.py` uses a hardcoded renewable-first merit-order. These policies return `EnergyAllocation` flags that could parameterize the dispatch function.

### Irrigation policies

**Options:** [fixed_schedule, deficit_irrigation, weather_adaptive]

**Context → Decision:** `CropPolicyContext` → `CropDecision`

### Economic policies

**Options:** [balanced, aggressive_growth, conservative, risk_averse]

**Context → Decision:** `EconomicPolicyContext` → `EconomicDecision`

## 5. Plots + Tables

### Inputs to outputs

Goal: Show the causal chain from volatile input prices to farm profitability, and demonstrate two key protective strategies — (1) self-owning water/energy infrastructure to stabilize input costs, and (2) crop and product diversification to stabilize revenues.

#### Metrics to track

**Input price metrics (from price data):**
- Municipal water price [$/m³] — government-supplied water price over time
- Grid electricity price [$/kWh] — government grid tariff over time
- Diesel price [$/L] — fuel price for backup generation and transport
- Fertilizer cost [$/ha] — aggregate input cost per hectare

**Effective cost metrics (computed, infrastructure-dependent):**
- Blended water cost [$/m³] — weighted average of self-produced (BWRO) and municipal water
- Blended energy cost [$/kWh] — weighted average of PV/wind, battery, grid, and diesel
- Total input cost [$/ha/month] — sum of water + energy + diesel + fertilizer + labor per hectare

**Revenue metrics (computed, diversification-dependent):**
- Crop price by type [$/kg] — farmgate price per crop (tomato, potato, onion, kale, cucumber)
- Revenue by crop [$/month] — monthly revenue per crop from fresh and processed sales
- Revenue concentration [%] — share of total revenue from single largest crop (lower = more diversified)

**Bottom-line metrics:**
- Net farm income [$/month] — total revenue minus total operating costs
- Operating margin [%] — (revenue - operating costs) / revenue
- Cost volatility [CV] — coefficient of variation of monthly total input costs (lower = more stable)

#### Plots (minimal set, 6 plots)

**Plot 1 — Input Price Index (time series, line chart)**
All four input prices (water, electricity, diesel, fertilizer) normalized to a base-year index = 100. Single chart, 4 lines. Establishes the problem: external prices are volatile and driven by government policy, currency devaluation, and global commodity markets. X: year, Y: price index.

**Plot 2 — Effective vs. Market Input Cost (paired bar or dual-line chart)**
Compares what the farm actually pays (blended cost from self-produced + purchased) vs. what it would pay buying everything from the government, for both water ($/m³) and energy ($/kWh). Two panels or two pairs of lines. Key insight: self-owned infrastructure costs are dominated by fixed O&M and debt service, so they flatten out relative to market price swings. X: year, Y: cost per unit.

**Plot 3 — Monthly Input Cost Breakdown (stacked area chart)**
Total monthly operating costs decomposed by category: water, energy, diesel, fertilizer, labor. Shows which inputs dominate the cost structure and which introduce the most month-to-month variability. X: month, Y: cost (USD).

**Plot 4 — Crop Prices and Revenue Diversification (2-panel chart)**
- Panel A: Crop price time series (5 lines, one per crop) showing different seasonal patterns and volatility. Establishes that any single crop is risky.
- Panel B: Monthly revenue stacked by crop, showing how shortfalls in one crop are offset by others. Demonstrates the diversification benefit.
X: month, Y: $/kg (panel A), USD (panel B).

**Plot 5 — Net Farm Income: Revenue vs. Costs (dual-line with fill)**
Revenue line and cost line over time, with the gap (net income) shaded. Optionally overlay a horizontal break-even line. Directly shows whether the farm is profitable and how stable that profit is. X: month, Y: USD.

**Plot 6 — Profit Margin Sensitivity (tornado chart)**
Shows the impact on net farm income of a ±20% swing in each input price (water, electricity, diesel, fertilizer) and each crop price. Bars extend left (negative impact) and right (positive impact) from the baseline. Directly answers: "which price change hurts (or helps) the most?" — guiding infrastructure and diversification priorities.

#### Tables (minimal set, 2 tables)

**Table 1 — Annual Cost Summary: Self-Owned vs. Government-Purchased**
One row per year. Columns: year, self-owned water cost, government water cost, savings (%), self-owned energy cost, government energy cost, savings (%), total input cost, net income. Shows cumulative economic advantage of infrastructure ownership.

**Table 2 — Revenue Diversification Summary**
One row per crop. Columns: crop, area fraction, annual yield (kg), fresh revenue ($), processed revenue ($), total revenue ($), revenue share (%), price CV. Shows contribution of each crop and product type to total revenue and highlights which crops are most volatile.
