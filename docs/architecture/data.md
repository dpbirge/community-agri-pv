# Data Organization Specification

**Document Version**: 1.0
**Date**: 2026-02-02
**Status**: Draft for review

## Overview

This document defines the data folder structure for the community agri-PV model. The organization follows the three-layer computational architecture (Layer 1: Pre-computation, Layer 2: Design, Layer 3: Simulation) and distinguishes between time-series data (temporally indexed) and parameter data (static characteristics).

## Design Principles

1. **Layer-aligned structure**: Data organization mirrors the computational layers
2. **Time-series vs parameters**: Fundamentally different data types in separate locations
3. **Filename suffixes**: Use `-toy`, `-research`, or `-real` to indicate data source/quality
4. **Embedded metadata**: All data files include header comments with source, units, dependencies, logic
5. **Human-readable formats**: CSV for all data files
6. **Iterative improvement**: Start with toy data, progressively replace with researched estimates, then empirical/simulated data
7. **Code stability**: Structure matches how code will access data (no rewiring as we build)

## Top-Level Structure

## Detailed Structure

### `data/precomputed/` - Layer 1 Outputs

Pre-computed physical libraries generated by Layer 1. These are indexed time-series and lookup tables that Layer 3 retrieves during simulation. All files are normalized (per-unit capacity or per-area) and deterministic given their inputs.

## Metadata Standards

Every CSV file must include a header comment block with the following fields:

- **SOURCE**: Where the data came from (paper citation, database, generation method)
- **DATE**: When the file was created or last updated
- **DESCRIPTION**: What the data represents
- **UNITS**: Units for each numeric column
- **LOGIC**: Calculation method or generation algorithm
- **DEPENDENCIES**: Other files this data depends on
- **ASSUMPTIONS**: Key assumptions made in generating the data
- **NOTES**: Any additional context

For toy data, SOURCE should clearly state it is synthetic/approximated and reference any assumptions or target ranges used.

---

## Settings Organization

Scenario and policy configurations live outside `data/` in the `settings/` folder:

### `settings/` - Scenario Configurations

The settings folder contains the scenario YAML file and the central data registry. Scenarios define infrastructure, community, policies, and are loaded by `src/settings/loader.py` into structured dataclasses.

**Current scenario file**: `settings/mvp-settings.yaml`

The scenario YAML structure uses `_system` suffixes for infrastructure sections (`water_system`, `energy_system`, `food_processing_system`) and references policies by name. See `structure.md` for the full schema.

**Data registry**: `settings/data_registry.yaml` maps logical data keys (e.g., `weather.scenario_001`) to file paths. The `SimulationDataLoader` uses this registry to resolve data at runtime.

### `src/policies/` - Policy Implementations

Policy classes live in `src/policies/` with a consistent pattern: context dataclass (input), decision/allocation dataclass (output), base class, concrete implementations, and a registry with factory function.

```
src/policies/
├── __init__.py               # Exports all policies, registries, and factory functions
├── water_policies.py         # 5 water allocation policies (integrated)
├── food_policies.py          # 4 food processing allocation policies (integrated)
├── energy_policies.py        # 3 energy dispatch policies (not yet integrated)
├── crop_policies.py          # 3 irrigation management policies (not yet integrated)
├── economic_policies.py      # 4 financial management policies (not yet integrated)
└── market_policies.py        # 4 sale timing policies (not yet integrated)
```

Policies are selected by name in the scenario YAML and instantiated during scenario loading. See `structure.md` Section 3 for the full policy catalog and integration status.

---

## Data Quality Evolution Path

All datasets follow this iterative improvement path:

1. **Toy data** (`-toy` suffix): Generated synthetic data with reasonable assumptions
   - Purpose: Enable model development and testing
   - Quality: Order-of-magnitude correct, captures key patterns
   - Example: Weather with generic hot/arid seasonality

2. **Research data** (`-research` suffix): Literature-based values grounded in published studies
   - Purpose: Improve realism using FAO, USDA, Egyptian government data, and academic sources
   - Quality: Representative of real-world ranges for the Sinai/Egypt context
   - Example: FAO crop coefficients, Egyptian HCWW water tariffs, Egyptian agricultural wages
   - **Current status:** 14+ research-grade files exist alongside toy data

3. **Real data** (`-real` suffix): Empirical measurements or validated simulations
   - Purpose: Location-specific accuracy for production runs
   - Quality: Actual historical data or high-fidelity simulations
   - Example: Historical weather from specific location, actual market price data

> **Note on suffix convention:** The original plan used `-toy` for both synthetic and researched estimates. The codebase now uses `-research` for literature-grounded data, reserving `-toy` for purely synthetic values. The `-real` suffix is reserved for future empirical data. The `SimulationDataLoader` has a `use_research_prices` flag to prefer `-research` files when available.

## Usage Notes

### For Model Development

1. **Start with toy data**: Generate minimal synthetic datasets to get Layer 3 running
2. **Focus on structure first**: Ensure file formats and indexing work correctly
3. **Add complexity incrementally**: Start with 1 crop, 1 weather scenario, 1 year
4. **Validate at each step**: Check that data flows correctly through layers before expanding

### For Data Research

1. **Prioritize high-sensitivity parameters**: Focus real data research on weather, crop yields, prices
2. **Document sources meticulously**: Embed all metadata in file headers
3. **Version control everything**: Track data quality improvements over time
4. **Create data validation scripts**: Automated checks for units, ranges, consistency

### For Scenario Design

1. **Use descriptive names**: `high_solar_low_battery.yaml` is better than `scenario_03.yaml`
2. **Document rationale**: Explain why infrastructure/policy choices were made
3. **Reference policies by name**: Don't embed policy logic in scenario files
4. **Test incrementally**: Start with deterministic runs before Monte Carlo

## Project Specifications Summary

### Location and Context
- **Location**: Sinai Peninsula along the Red Sea, Egypt
- **Climate**: Hot, arid desert requiring year-round irrigation
- **Cropping**: Multiple growing seasons per year (2-3 seasons for fast crops, 1 for slower crops)
- **Community scale**: 20 farms, 500 hectares total farmland, ~150 population

### Crop Selection (updated from original plan)
1. **Tomato** — Multiple seasons/year, high value, export potential
2. **Potato** — Single season, staple crop, storage crop
3. **Onion** — Single season, staple crop, excellent storage
4. **Kale** — Multiple seasons, nutritious, heat-tolerant leafy green
5. **Cucumber** — Multiple seasons, high export value, processing potential

> **Note:** The original model plan specified wheat, lettuce, and melon instead of potato, onion, and kale. The crop selection was updated to better reflect Sinai agricultural context (staple crops with storage potential, heat tolerance, and diverse market channels).

### Time Series Parameters
- **Weather data**: Single scenario, 15 years (2010-2024) of synthetic data for Sinai Red Sea climate
- **Price data**: 10 years (2015-2024) where available from real sources, extend with synthetic
- **Alignment**: Real data where available, toy data to fill gaps

### Infrastructure Specifications

#### Irrigation
- **Technology**: Drip irrigation only (90% efficiency)
- **Design**: Extensible for future irrigation methods

#### Solar PV (Agri-PV)
- **Configuration**: Fixed-tilt, ~28° angle (mid-Sinai latitude)
- **Optimization**: Fall-spring peak output, reduced summer performance
- **Panel height**: 3 meters above crops
- **Density variants**:
  - High: 80% ground coverage (heavy shade)
  - Medium: 50% coverage (balanced)
  - Low: 30% coverage (light shade, maximum crop light)
- **Type**: Single panel type, three installation densities

#### Wind Turbines
- **Variants**: 3 representative microgrid-scale turbine sizes
- **Differentiation**: Different performance in varying wind conditions, different cost-benefit ratios
- **Focus**: Normalized power curves and costs

#### Diesel Generator
- **Baseline**: 100 kW unit (irrigation pumps + critical building loads)
- **Backup purpose**: Pumps and some building backup (not full community power)
- **Scalability**: Can add more units if needed

#### Water Systems
- **Sources**: Brackish groundwater (onsite desalination) + municipal water
- **Brackish salinity levels**: Model all three types with cost data
  - Light: 1,000-3,000 ppm TDS
  - Moderate: 3,000-10,000 ppm TDS
  - Heavy: 10,000+ ppm TDS
- **Baseline salinity**: 5,000 ppm TDS (moderate) for default scenarios

### Processing and Storage

#### Processing Types
1. **Fresh sales**: Local markets (no processing)
2. **Packaged fresh**: Export to Europe (cleaning, packaging, cold chain)
3. **Canned**: Preservation processing
4. **Dried/dehydrated**: Vegetable powder and dried products
5. **NO freezing**: Not modeled

#### Processing Capacity
- **Sizing basis**: Derived from peak harvest rates (e.g., drying sized to handle 10% of peak daily harvest)
- **Note**: Actual capacities determined by farm yields, not arbitrary values

### Economic Parameters

#### Currency
- **Primary**: USD for all model calculations
- **Documentation**: Original currency (EGP, EUR) documented with conversion rates and sources
- **Conversion**: Track exchange rates used for transparency

#### Labor
- **Wages**: Egyptian agricultural wages by activity type
- **Categories**:
  - Field work (planting, weeding, harvesting, irrigation)
  - Management and administration
  - Canning and processing operations
  - Packaging operations
  - Maintenance and logistics
- **Availability**: Unlimited labor (not a constraint), but costs tracked

#### Pricing
- **Crop prices**: Global food prices (FAO, USDA) as baseline
- **Export prices**: European market prices + shipping cost estimates
- **Electricity**: Egyptian agricultural electricity tariffs (researched)
- **Water**: Egyptian municipal water prices (researched)
- **Diesel**: Egyptian diesel prices (researched)

### Energy and Water Loads

#### Community Energy Demand
Model includes:
- **Irrigation pumps**: Primary load
- **Water treatment**: Desalination energy
- **Housing**: Small AC units, refrigerators, lighting (~150 people)
- **Processing facilities**: Canning, drying, packaging operations
- **Administrative buildings**: Offices, storage facilities
- **Farm equipment**: Hand-operated machinery (no tractors)

#### Community Water Demand
Model includes:
- **Irrigation**: Primary demand
- **Domestic**: Housing and sanitation (~150 people)
- **Processing**: Washing, canning, cleaning operations
- **Facilities**: Administrative building needs

### Grid Reliability
- **Modeling**: Price variations only (no brownouts/outages in initial model)
- **Tariff structure**: Agricultural rates, may include time-of-use if available
- **Future**: Can add outage modeling in later phases

### Data Sources Strategy
- **General approach**: Widely available global datasets for rapid initial development
- **Egyptian-specific priority**: Energy prices (electricity, diesel), water prices, labor wages
- **Quality evolution**: Toy → researched estimates → real data (iterative improvement)

### Monte Carlo Configuration
- **Location**: Implemented in `src/simulation/monte_carlo.py` (not a separate settings folder)
- **Status**: Functional — stochastic price/yield sampling with configurable CVs and N runs
- **Sensitivity**: Implemented in `src/simulation/sensitivity.py` — ±20% one-at-a-time analysis
- **Future**: Weather scenario variation, equipment failure events, correlation structure

## Next Steps

1. **Create folder structure**: Set up empty directories and README files
2. **Generate initial toy datasets**: Start with minimal viable datasets (1 crop, 1 weather scenario)
3. **Define CSV schemas**: Create template files with proper metadata headers
4. **Build data validation tools**: Scripts to check units, ranges, required columns
5. **Create example scenario file**: Baseline configuration to test data loading
6. **Document policy definitions**: Write first policy implementation with natural language docs
