# SOURCE: Synthetic data for community agri-PV model
# DATE: 2026-02-06
# DESCRIPTION: Community building types with energy and water demand profiles
# UNITS: building_area_m2 (square meters), kwh_per_m2_per_day (kWh/m²/day), m3_per_m2_per_day (m³/m²/day)
# LOGIC: Community buildings include offices, storage, meeting halls, workshops
# LOGIC: Energy demand for lighting, ventilation, small appliances, tools
# LOGIC: Water demand for bathrooms, cleaning, drinking water
# DEPENDENCIES: None
# ASSUMPTIONS: Hot arid climate requires some cooling/ventilation
# ASSUMPTIONS: Non-residential buildings have lower per-m² demand than housing
# ASSUMPTIONS: Office space has highest energy (AC/lighting), storage lowest
# ASSUMPTIONS: Water use primarily for sanitation and cleaning
