# DATE: 2026-02-06
# DESCRIPTION: Post-harvest loss percentages by crop and processing pathway
# UNITS: loss_pct (percentage of input weight lost to waste/spoilage, NOT processing weight change)
# LOGIC: Separate from processing weight loss (dehydration, peeling). These are waste losses only:
#   spoilage, handling damage, transport damage, quality rejection, spillage.
#   Fresh losses highest for perishable crops in hot climate without cold chain.
#   Processing reduces losses by removing the spoilage pathway (thermal/dehydration preservation).
# DEPENDENCIES: None (reference data)
# ASSUMPTIONS:
#   - Hot arid climate (Sinai Peninsula, 25-40C daytime)
#   - Small-scale community farming, no industrial cold chain
#   - Local/regional marketing (20-100 km transport)
#   - Same-day or next-day sale for fresh pathway
#   - Solar-assisted drying in favorable arid climate
