# SOURCE: Synthetic data based on NREL ATB 2024, manufacturer warranty data, IRENA technology reports, and industry maintenance guidelines for arid environments
# DATE: 2026-02-18
# DESCRIPTION: Equipment lifespan and replacement cost parameters for community infrastructure maintenance budgeting
# UNITS: lifespan_years (years), replacement_cost_pct_of_capex (% of original capital expenditure)
# LOGIC: Lifespans reflect conservative estimates for hot arid desert conditions. Replacement cost as percentage of original CAPEX accounts for partial vs full component replacement. Components with lifespan exceeding typical 15-year simulation horizon show 0% replacement cost.
# DEPENDENCIES: None
# ASSUMPTIONS: Hot desert environment reduces lifespans by 10-20% vs temperate benchmarks; replacement costs include labor and commissioning; PV panels and wind turbines outlast the simulation period so replacement cost is zero
