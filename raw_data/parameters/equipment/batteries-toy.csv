# DESCRIPTION: Battery energy storage system specifications for microgrid applications
# UNITS: capacity_kwh (kWh), power_kw (kW), round_trip_efficiency (decimal), cycle_life (cycles), depth_of_discharge_pct (%), lifespan_years (years), capital_cost_per_kwh (USD/kWh), soc_min (decimal), soc_max (decimal), charge_efficiency (decimal), discharge_efficiency (decimal), initial_soc (decimal)
# LOGIC: Lithium iron phosphate (LFP) chosen for hot climate tolerance and safety. Cycle life based on 80% depth of discharge. Power rating assumes 4-hour discharge duration. Costs decrease with larger units due to economies of scale. SOC limits (10%-90%) protect battery longevity. Charge/discharge efficiencies are one-way (sqrt of round-trip). Initial SOC at 50% per architecture spec.
# DEPENDENCIES: None
# ASSUMPTIONS: Hot desert environment reduces cycle life by ~10% vs temperate; includes battery management system; flow battery included as alternative for longer duration storage
