# SOURCE: Engineering estimates for brackish groundwater pumping systems in arid regions
# DATE: 2026-02-18
# DESCRIPTION: Pump system parameters for hydraulic energy calculations and infrastructure distance modeling
# UNITS: As specified in unit column
# LOGIC: Pump efficiency reflects combined pump+motor efficiency for submersible centrifugal pumps in brackish water applications. Default pipe and distance parameters are used when site-specific values are unavailable. Distance coefficients model average spacing between infrastructure components based on geometric distribution in a square region: E[d] = coeff * sqrt(A) / sqrt(n).
# DEPENDENCIES: Used by src/settings/calculations.py calculate_pumping_energy() and calculate_distances()
# ASSUMPTIONS: (1) PVC pipe material with friction factor 0.02, (2) Brackish water density 1025 kg/m3, (3) Distance coefficients calibrated for typical rural infrastructure placement
