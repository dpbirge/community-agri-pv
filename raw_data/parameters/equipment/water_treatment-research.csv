# DESCRIPTION: Brackish water reverse osmosis (BWRO) treatment specifications for 3 salinity levels - research-validated parameters
# UNITS: tds_ppm (mg/L), energy_kwh_per_m3 (kWh/m³), membrane_life_months (months), recovery_rate_pct (%), capital_cost_per_m3_day (USD per m³/day capacity), maintenance_cost_per_m3 (USD/m³)
# LOGIC: Energy consumption scales with TDS due to osmotic pressure (~1 psi additional pressure per 100 ppm TDS increase). Recovery rate decreases with TDS to prevent scaling (CaCO3, CaSO4, silica). At ~15,000 ppm, system approaches SWRO territory requiring higher-pressure membranes. Membrane life decreases with TDS due to fouling and cleaning frequency. Capital costs increase with TDS due to higher-pressure pumps, additional pre-treatment, and energy recovery devices needed.
# DEPENDENCIES: None
# ASSUMPTIONS: Hot arid environment (Egypt/Sinai) reduces membrane life ~15-20% vs temperate baseline. Small-scale systems (100-500 m³/day capacity) have higher per-unit costs than large municipal plants. Costs include pre-treatment (cartridge filtration, antiscalant dosing) and post-treatment (remineralization). No energy recovery device (ERD) for low salinity; ERD optional for moderate; ERD required for high. USD 2024 equivalent values.
# DATA_QUALITY: Research-grade - values derived from peer-reviewed literature and manufacturer specifications. Ranges validated across multiple sources (PMC, MDPI, ACS, DuPont). Energy values represent typical operational SEC, not theoretical minimums.
# COMPARISON_TO_TOY: Toy file overestimated energy for low (1.0 vs 0.7 kWh/m³) and high (4.0 vs 2.8 kWh/m³) salinity. Toy file overestimated recovery rates (88% vs 75% for low; 70% vs 50% for high). Toy file underestimated maintenance costs. Capital costs in toy file were reasonable for small-scale but research shows wider range ($500-$1500/m³/day).

# KEY RESEARCH FINDINGS:
# - BWRO energy: 0.5-2.5 kWh/m³ typical range (vs SWRO 2.5-5.4 kWh/m³)
# - At 2000 ppm: ~0.5-1.0 kWh/m³ achievable with 80-85% recovery
# - At 5000-6000 ppm: ~1.5 kWh/m³ with 65-75% recovery
# - At 10,000-15,000 ppm: approaching SWRO territory, 2.5-3.5 kWh/m³, recovery 50-65%
# - Membrane life: 2-5 years typical, 24-36 months for brackish applications
# - OPEX: $0.39-0.66/m³ for large plants; $0.60-1.18/m³ for small-scale
# - CAPEX: $500-2947/m³/day depending on capacity, location, water quality
# - Small-scale PV-BWRO: $1.37-9.00/m³ total water cost
