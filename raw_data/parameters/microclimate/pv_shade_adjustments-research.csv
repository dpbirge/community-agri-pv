# DESCRIPTION: Research-validated microclimate adjustments for agri-PV systems. Quantifies how solar panel ground coverage ratio (GCR) affects air temperature, solar irradiance reaching crops, wind speed, and evapotranspiration beneath panels. Values derived from peer-reviewed field studies and meta-analyses spanning multiple climate zones with emphasis on hot arid conditions relevant to Sinai Peninsula location.
# UNITS: ground_coverage_pct (percentage of ground area covered by panel projection 0-100); temp_adjustment_c (degrees Celsius change from ambient, negative = cooling); irradiance_multiplier (fraction of full-sun PAR reaching crop level, 0-1 where 1.0 = unshaded); wind_speed_multiplier (fraction of ambient wind speed at crop level, 0-1 where 1.0 = no obstruction); evapotranspiration_multiplier (fraction of reference ET, 0-1 where 1.0 = no reduction)
# LOGIC: Evapotranspiration reduction derives from three mechanisms: (1) reduced solar radiation decreases energy available for evaporation, (2) cooler air temperatures lower vapor pressure deficit (VPD), (3) reduced wind speed decreases boundary layer mixing. ET_multiplier approximated as: irradiance_effect * temperature_effect * wind_effect. Research shows ET reductions of 10-30% at low-medium GCR (Marrou 2013), up to 81% directly under panels at high coverage (Italy 2025 study). Values calibrated to represent spatial average across planted area, not just directly-under-panel measurements.
# DEPENDENCIES: None - standalone reference table. Used by irrigation_demand calculations and crop_yield models in Layer 3 simulation.
# ASSUMPTIONS: Panel mounting height 3.0m (elevated agri-PV design); fixed-tilt south-facing at 28 degrees (optimal for 28N latitude); bifacial panels not considered; values represent growing-season (April-October) averages; microclimate effects assume adequate panel spacing for agricultural equipment access; values are spatial averages across the planted area (not just directly under panels).
# DATA_QUALITY: MODERATE-HIGH. Based on peer-reviewed research from 2011-2025. Meta-analysis data from 320 experiments across 111 sites. Primary uncertainty: most studies conducted in Mediterranean/temperate climates; fewer studies in hot arid conditions similar to Sinai. Panel height and configuration vary across studies. Temperature and irradiance data well-validated; ET multipliers have higher uncertainty due to measurement methodology differences.
# COMPARISON_TO_TOY: Low density (30% GCR): temp_adjustment_c matches toy (-0.5 to -1.0C range, we use -0.8C vs toy -0.75C); irradiance_multiplier adjusted down (0.65 vs toy 0.80) based on meta-analysis showing ~35% reduction at 30% coverage; wind_speed_multiplier unchanged (0.95); ET_multiplier adjusted down (0.85 vs toy 0.925) reflecting 10-30% ET reduction from Marrou 2013. Medium density (50% GCR): temp_adjustment_c matches toy (-1.5C); irradiance_multiplier adjusted down (0.50 vs toy 0.60) based on Lopez-Diaz data showing 46.6% reduction at 30% shading extrapolated; wind_speed_multiplier unchanged (0.85); ET_multiplier slightly adjusted (0.80 vs toy 0.875). High density (80% GCR): temp_adjustment_c increased (-2.5C vs toy -3.0C) to be more conservative; irradiance_multiplier unchanged (0.35); wind_speed_multiplier reduced (0.60 vs toy 0.70) based on vertical agrivoltaics CFD modeling showing 40% wind reduction; ET_multiplier reduced (0.55 vs toy 0.75) reflecting Italy study showing 81% reduction under panels.
# KEY_RESEARCH_VALUES: Barron-Gafford 2019: daytime air temp 1.3C cooler (meta-analysis average), soil moisture 15% higher, tomato yield 2x, chiltepin 3x. Marrou 2013: ET reduced 10-30%, solar radiation reduced ~30% at 3.2m panel spacing. Fraunhofer ISE: soil temp cooler in summer, 30% less solar irradiation, 40% higher yields for tomatoes in India. Meta-analysis 2025: GCR<25% needed for >80% relative yield; 40-50% shading has non-significant yield impact; >60% shading significantly reduces yield. Italy 2025: ET reduced 81% directly under panels, 13% between panels.
