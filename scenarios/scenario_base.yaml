# Scenario 1: Baseline Community Agri-PV
#
# Composes domain-specific settings files for a single simulation run.
# Swap any domain value to a different settings file to mix-and-match
# configurations without touching other domains.

description: Baseline community — research-grade energy data, toy-grade water and building data

# --- Simulation Period ---
simulation:
  start_date: "2023-01-01"
  end_date: "2023-12-31"
  weather_scenario_id: null  # null = use first/only scenario found in data files

# --- Data Registry ---
# Central index mapping logical data names to file paths.
# Swap to an alternate registry to change data quality tiers (toy vs research)
# across multiple domains at once.
data_registry: settings/data_registry.yaml

# --- Domain Settings ---
# Each key points to the settings file for that domain.
# Swap any single entry to run an alternative configuration for that domain.
