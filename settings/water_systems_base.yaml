# Water Systems Configuration
# Defines one or more independent water supply systems for the community
#
# Each system contains: wells, one treatment unit, one municipal source,
# and an optional storage tank. Most simulations use a single system.
#
# Data files: see water_supply section in settings/data_registry.yaml
