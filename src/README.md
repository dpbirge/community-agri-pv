# Source Code (Layer 3: Simulation Engine)

This folder will contain the Layer 3 simulation engine code.

## Planned Structure

- Daily time-step simulation loop
- Physical flow tracking (water, energy, crops)
- Material balance reconciliation
- Policy execution framework
- Economic accounting system

## Status

Not started. See [docs/planning/community-model-plan.md](../docs/planning/community-model-plan.md) for architecture specifications.

## Prerequisites

Requires completion of:
- Layer 1 (Pre-computation): Complete
- Layer 2 (Configuration): Partially complete (water policies functional, others stubbed)
